<1>The food here is always excellent. We went on a Saturday night to celebrate our anniversary, and it seems like they are handling things during COVID pretty seamlessly. The only thing to note is they aren't doing valet during this time -- wasn't a huge deal, but still aggravating as the valet service is usually part of the "experience" here.Our server Tim was awesome, he accommodated us when we asked to switch from the awkward table they put us in to a booth, and he let us take our time enjoying our wine with each course and ordering slowly.We come here for most special occasions and will continue to do so.Stars of the menu: the lobster & crab cakes, lobster bisque, the beef tenderloin with lobster tails, and the RouteStock Cabernet.</1>
<2>Thank you so much for making my friends birthday meal so special even during Covid!! We had phenomenal take out. It was delicious, great portions, nice set ups. I missed dining out on special occasions and this really brought it home for us. Filet and Delmonico seared to perfectionAsparagus and mashed potatoes were perfect Even the French onion soup traveled well with a nice size side salad. Thank you so much!!</2>
<3>It was our pleasure, Natosha - so glad your friend had a wonderful birthday! We hope for the chance to help with a meal again soon.All the best,Justin</3>
<4>We were a little nervous to go out to dinner with all of the Covid restrictions...but we wanted to celebrate our anniversary and haven't been out since February. we weren't sure what to expect when we arrived at the restaurant, but we were pleasantly surprised that the restricted occupancy made us feel like we had a private dining reservation. We had an entire room to ourselves, and the wait stuff was phenomenal. I ordered the seared tenderloin with lobster tail poached and butter. The lobster was so delicate.. it couldn't have been cooked more perfectly. It completely melted in your mouth with every bite. The hubs got the steak au poivre, and it was cooked to beautifully. What a nice change of pace being able to go out and enjoy a nice dinner in the city. We definitely wouldn't hesitate to go back with or without restrictions in place.</4>
<5>I was in from out of town and wanted something delicious. That's exactly what I found. Consider there was a Bentley Continental GT , Porsche GT2 RS, Lamborghini Huracan performante convertible, and a BMW 760LI parked out front, I knew two things...this was a great place to get good food, and it wasn't the most affordable in town. I loved the atmosphere inside. The wine list is extensive, and my steak and lobster were excellent. The wait staff are top notch...but I do have a complaint. Maybe it's just me being nitpicky, but I was annoyed when I asked to see a wine menu. The waiter brought over an iPad with the wine which was great, and immediately pulled up the "by the glass" section. I love wine and lived in Sonoma Country California aka Wine Country for a number of years. I don't buy wine by the glass, and I ended up getting a Cabernet that was almost $90. Granted, I might not have been dressed like some of the others in the restaurant, but I had on pretty nice clothes and if the server would have noticed my shoes and watch he would have known I'm not a cheapskate. I don't care about expensive things, but I feel like he assumed that I wasn't willing to spend the money for a nice bottle of wine, but maybe that's in my head. I felt like he profiled me because I wasn't wearing a suit. It was an unexpected trip, and I was dining alone and didn't plan to bring extremely nice clothes. Maybe he just didn't think I would drink an entire bottle, but it was kind of annoying.</5>
<6>I visited this past Saturday for the first time. I must say it was better than expected. I dined alone and ordered the Porcini Rubbed Bone-In Ribeye with 15-Year Aged Balsamic. I ordered to Medium Rare, the ribeye had so much flavor I was able to overlook the majority of the ribeye temperature which was more medium well. I would recommend this dish as well as returning hopefully for the right temperature ribeye next time. The grille has a great atmosphere, and very well mannered staff.</6>
<7>This place is very classy. The food is also decent. Capital Grille is a chain throughout the United States however, it does not feel like a chain at all. I've only been to the Pittsburgh location and it exemplifies sophistication. The interior is very dim and gives me cigar den or speakeasy vibes. There are some taxidermy and portraits of famous Pittsburghers that line the walls. The customer service is also very good here. The person that helped my table was very kind and knowledgeable of the food.The food is good. I only say good because I was not particularly wowed by anything I ate. Maybe this place is too sophisticated for me, I'm more into inventive modern dishes compared to classics. Everything I ate was good and perfectly seasoned and cooked. The options are limited and there are not many fun, inventive dishes. Although, if you are looking for good quality classics- this place is for you.</7>
<8>I came here for a birthday celebration as my husband is a big fan of a food steak. We made reservations on open table and were seated right on time. When we arrived at the table, there was a happy birthday card in addition to birthday confetti on the table which was very thoughtful. We also received a complimentary champagne toast. Our waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable and made our dining experience very enjoyable. For appetizers we ordered the tuna tartare which was excellent. It was a bit spicy so be aware when ordering. It tasted very fresh and the mango sauce on the side was a nice balance. I ordered the sliced filet medium and my husband ordered the filet mignon medium rare. Both were excellent cooked to perfection. For sides we got the lobster Mac and cheese which came with large chunks of lobster. I enjoyed this dish but wish it was more creamy. At the end they came out with a birthday dessert which consisted of cheesecake and a coffee chocolate cake. Both of these were good but nothing amazing. Of note we did get charged $5 for this. I think this should be comped considering the $50 price tag on each steak. Overall I really enjoyed my experience at the capital grille. The atmosphere of the restaurant is very cozy and the service is excellent. It's a great place to celebrate a special occasion at!</8>
<9>It's restaurant week and I am so glad I finally had an opportunity to dine here. Having made a reservation I was seated promptly in one of the side dining rooms near the bar. Although the place is upscale the daytime dress is usually business casual.For a $20.19 3 course meal they had a good selection to choose from. I decided to go with their tossed salad to start followed by their seared honey glazed salmon with green beans and almonds. For my dessert I chose the flourless espresso chocolate cake. Service was top notch and I was given both heated dinner rolls as well as a huge delicious wafer I could break off and enjoy my meal with. The restaurant is adorned with paintings of local notables such as Andrew Carnegie. I noticed that being centrally located in the city the Capital Grill is a great place to hold a business luncheon and as others have noted a good place for special occasions. Free WiFi is available. My salad was delicious and my salmon entree was served on a very hot plate. Although it appeared small it was fairly dense and cooked to perfection. I got the opportunity to meet the manager Nick who welcomed me and asked if I needed anything then to see him. Service was exceptional and they made sure I had plenty of drink as well as cleaning my table. Can't forget the piece de resistance-the flourless chocolate espresso cake with cream and a raspberry. Cake was small but oh so rich and yummy! Best known as one of the city's many steakhouses I was glad that they have other options to choose from. Located in Piatt Place on 5th Ave across from the Milkshake factory public transportation as well as nearby parking garages are available.</9>
<10>It has one of the best restaurant week menus. In summary, the food was decent and the indoor decor was classic, but we felt it was a little overpriced with the regular menu. I was expecting more carefully designed dishes, in the sense of more delicate flavors and more beautiful plates. However, it was a good deal  to come on restaurant week. Clam chowder: very creamy, thicker than others I've had. Bleu cheese salad: it was half a cabbage with salad sauce and some bleu cheese. It was fine. Nothing special.Filet Mignon: I had better and cheaper(in regular menu, it is almost 50) filet mignon before. It was soft but I felt they only use salt for the flavor. NY strip: Tasted similar as the filet mignon, but it was a little burnt outside.We liked the sides for the steak. The smashed potato was very creamy and buttery. Cheesecake: a little too soft. Chocolate cake: very bitter, I can tell it was made with pure dark chocolate.</10>
<11>Let me start by saying the only other time I at The Capital Grille, we were in Atlanta.  That restaurant is on the top floor and the skyline view was amazing.  In fact the whole dining experience was amazing.  So, the bar was set high for us going into our dinner at the Capital Grille in Pittsburgh.  The restaurant is on the ground floor of an older building in Pittsburgh which has a certain charm as well. Reservations were for 8:45 on Saturday.  I got a call a few days prior asking me to confirm, which I did.  We got to the Capital Grille at 8:37.   The lobby and bar were packed.  No mention to us of a wait.  However, I overheard someone mentioning to others as they checked in that it would be a wait ranging from 10 minutes to 20 minutes.  We got seated at 9:07.  I am wondering why I made a reservation.  We rarely wait more than 5 minutes at other restaurants.  The service was average.  Overall the food was good.  My wife had trouble finding lobster in her bisque.  A bit of a disappointment.   Not sure we will make it to the capital Grille in Pittsburgh again.  We've had as good and better at a better price point and we don't have to wait so long for a table we reserved.</11>
<12>We had 5:00 reservations and we were 20 mins early and were seated within 5 minutes. Superb service. The waitress had as assistant who went around to replenish waters. We were seated in the bar side per our request and wound up with a lovely private table/half booth! The wedge and field green salads were both very fresh and flavorful.The salmon was done medium and was perfect with a crusted top and perfect amount of seasoning. The mashed potatoes were nothing spectacular. The green beans were fresh but not a whole lot of seasoning. The strip steak was very good and a fine choice of meat. The mini desserts were out of this world! We had a mini cheesecake and an espresso cake. This place makes for an awesome date night in the city just a block from market square to take a stroll afterward!</12>
<13>Recently had the opportunity to eat here for a work event and could not have been happier.  The atmosphere, service, and food were all top-notch.It was restaurant week during our visit which made for a shorter menu than usual.  However, every dish looked and tasted delicious.  For my meal I went with the field greens salad.  The salad had a great flavor and I loved the dressing.  Made for a great starter.  For my meal I went with the Grille's Signature Cheeseburger.  I ordered mine medium rare and it was cooked to perfection.  The meat is topped with a delicious white cheddar and candied bacon.  The sweetened bacon and high-quality cheese made for a great flavor.  The meat was a delicious blend and tasted very fresh.  The bun was also a great choice and held everything together perfectly.  The burger came with a side of truffle fries which had a great crispy texture to them.  The fries went very well with their house made ranch.</13>
<14>I do not get a reason to eat at Capital Grille very often, however I needed to be in downtown Pittsburgh today for work lunch so I took advantage.  As always the service was spectacular and the food matched.  I had the ahi tuna which I think I have had each of the last two trips to Capital Grill.  It was amazing.  The rice was perfect as well as the asparagus.  Always perfect.</14>
<15>My husband and I came in for dinner before the theatre. Our server Fonz was amazing! He treated us like the most important table in the room. We started off with the Tuna Tartare appetizer and BURRATA WITH HEIRLOOM TOMATOES salad. Both portions are large so we were able to share. Both of our steaks were cooked perfectly. It was a perfectly romantic evening.</15>
<16>We were a party of 13. We got to the bar about 1/2 hour before our reservation. We hung at the bar for a bit. The hostess at first tried to tell us we had to be seated in 6 min. We laughed and told her once seated, that table was full for the night! She came back and said whenever we are ready.What can I say about the food? It's outstanding as all cap grilles are! We had numerous appetizers, hot and cold. Everything was great. The bone-in filet, although not in the menu, is a death row meal. Mashed potatoes were awesome. Everything was great. Service perfect.</16>
<17>Came here for restaurant week, and got to try the steak at Capital Grille.The starters were standard---can't complain about New England clam chowder. I do have to say the lettuce wedge salad was a bit...doused in dressing.The Dry Aged New York Strip sounded good on paper---my waiter told me they age their steaks for 18-24 days. However, when I actually tasted the steak, I couldn't tell if it was aged or not. Overall, it was a solid piece of meat, but could use some more seasoning. As for the filet---it came out way more raw than it should have. A rare looked like a blue rare when I cut into it, so I had to send it back to the kitchen.I'm not sure if the food wasn't as good because of restaurant week, but nearly everything else about the restaurant---wine menu, service, ambiance, are great.</17>
<18>We recently dined here as part of Pittsburgh's restaurant week special. I had actually been recommended to come here for a while, and we figured that we would take advantage of the deal. This restaurant was fantastic! They have a very nice selection of wines, and we began our dinner with the New England clam chowder. Our waiter was exceptional, tolerating my boyfriend's bad dad jokes all night. Our soup was followed by the main course. We both ordered steaks. I ordered an 8oz filet mignon, topped with crab oscar, and he ordered a 14oz NY strip with a side of lobster tail. The steaks were cooked perfectly, and tasted amazing. Interestingly, the lobster tail had already been stripped from the actual shell of the lobster, so we were presented with just the meat and butter. It was a different way to present. Our food was fantastic. Both entrees included a side of mashed potatoes and green beans, which we barely touched because we were so focused on the entrees before us. We ended up taking some of the food home, which means left overs!The meal ended with dessert. I ordered a cheesecake, while he ordered an espresso chocolate cake. I think I made the better decision, for sure. Overall, the food was fantastic. The restaurant was incredibly busy for a Monday night, likely due to the special, so reservations are a must! That being said, we still got ample attention and service, and our meal was wonderful. We had a fantastic night, and will be sure to dine again, this time with the full menu.</18>
<19>Food was average and not worth the price. My lamb chops were good, but my boyfriends steak was overly coated in peppercorns. Was not aware that there were breadcrumbs on the lobster Mac and cheese. It did not state that on the menu. There was practically no lobster in the Mac and cheese. Probably less than my cup of lobster bisque. It was super greasy and did not taste good.</19>
<20>Great ambience but a rather mediocre-flavored dry-aged NY strip steak despite the recommended Kona coffee rub. Cheesecake was a saving grace with its fluffiness complemented by the hard sugar crystals.</20>
<21>We came here on Friday for restaurant week and it did not disappoint. It was pretty packed, but we made reservations; which I'm glad that we did. We had to wait about 10 min for a table, which I didn't mind. Once seated, we were greeted by our waiter right away. He took our drink order and brought out bread and better. We went with the restaurant menu which was 3 courses for $36. I started with the New England clam chowder. It was so good. You definitely have to get this when you come! For my entree, I got an 8 Oz filet mignon and I chose to have my "Oscar style" for an additional $12 (again, you need to do this). The filet was cooked perfectly (I got mine medium) and the Bernaise sauce and lump crab meat was plentiful. Well worth the upgrade! The special also included mashed potatoes (melt in your mouth -creamy) and green beans for the table to share. Lastly for dessert, I got the flourless chocolate espresso cake. Again, it was melt in your mouth creamy and so good. The Capital Grille did not disappoint in taste, flavor, and service. We were treated so well and I would recommend this place to any and everyone. I can't wait to come back here again!</21>

<1>Start your review of The Porch at Schenley.</1>
<2>its the time of the covid19...The porch is a winner when it comes to outdoor diningmake your reservation first easy outside seating well spread apart friendly service and delicious food I have been to the porch back in the olden days when you could still eat inside, I am happy to say I like their new ways even better.We tried them for a late breakfast a few weeks agoI like their limited menu and its on paper for one time usewe had biscuits with jam and butter they were so goodsalad with salmonnext visit we did a birthday dinner salads were right on good burger hit the spot drinks were nice we were very happy the waiter was right on top he was perfect in bringing us plates and a knife to cut the cake menu has salads burgers pizza and that day mussels prices are not cheapie this is a good place that is practicing covid19 safety there for I will gladly return</2>
<3>My girls and I had a delightful meal in their outdoor dining "tent" on college drop-off day. Given our current COVID-19 days, I felt very comfortable out there and how the staff handled all of the logistics in a very responsible way.We weren't terribly hungry, so we decided to split a pizza and a burger between the three of us. The margherita pizza had a chewy crust, slightly charred on the bottom. The pie was simple (as the margherita style normally is) but had a delicious tomato sauce and came with small sides of fresh shredded parmesan, herbs and red pepper flakes on the platter / tray. The burger was char-grilled on a flattop and served a nice medium. The smashed, fried potatoes on the side had heavy sea salt on them and were crispy outside and fluffy inside. The accompanying ketchup had some sort of kick (maybe horseradish?) that went great with these "fries".The servers were a bit overwhelmed the day we were there, but seemed to take it in stride and provided us with very decent service. I've heard they have a lovely brunch menu...might be worth a try next time in town.</3>
<4>The Porch is doing a great job with adapting to COVID. They have reduced the number of seats inside and have substantially increased their outdoor seating.  I went their twice, once for lunch and one for happy hour, and both times I was well spaced from others with tables about 10 ft apart.  You do have to go inside to order at lunch but there wasn't anyone else in line and all the staff wore masks.  They do allow a few groups to sit inside but the tables are very well spaced out.  Their food is excellent as always. I always appreciate how their menu rotates options with the seasons to provide local fresh ingredients.  Their beer draft list and other drink options are also excellent. Since this is one of the more expensive Oakland places, it doesn't get as crowded with undergraduate Pitt students as some of the other local places.</4>
<5>Great nighttime ambience. The fam chose outdoor seating. Even though there is indoor seating options available now, we still wanted to be cautious. Service was friendly & quick! As for food, bf ordered the lobster tater tots to start, along with the honey old fashioned? And for his entree the hangar steak with risotto. My daughter chose the cornbread to start and the chicken pasta Alfredo for her main. While I waited patiently for the 8oz strip steak with potatoes. We split the creme brûlée for dessert. BF liked everything he ordered. My daughter prefers a sweeter cornbread than what was served, although she did say the texture of the cornbread was good.The potatoes with my steak were perfect! Well seasoned, with just enough crunch on the exterior while the interior was soft without being mushy. I ordered my steak medium well, should have stuck to medium considering it was an 8oz portion.Over all a pleasant experience. And would go back to try other items on the menu.</5>
<6>This was my first dining experience here.  So very pleased with venue, service, and food.Plenty of seating outdoors and it was shaded when we were there after 5pm.Staff is employing all the COVID-19 rules as they rapidly change. Masks and social distancing were in play and menus are paper single use. The menu options are plenty including salads, pizzas, and main courses.I had a pineapple sage margarita, 2 actually, and the New York Strip with crispy potatoes in an aioli sauce.  The steak was tender, moist, and scrumptious. It melted in my mouth.Our server was pleasant, efficient, and clued us in on the coronavirus rules of the day.And just a side note. This is in Schenley plaza and within that space is a seating area with benches and a perennial flower garden that is in its full glory right now.</6>
<7>This restaurant has outdoor seating and practices all covid precautions. Super happy to see. My salad was wonderful as always. I added salmon to my strawberry and arugula salad, which was perfectly done. The Arnold Palmer was refreshing on a warm day out on their patio. Staff was super friendly and the service was pretty quick for lunch. I was in and out in less than an hour for a sit down lunch. Will definitely go back again.</7>
<8>The food was excellent the cocktails were excellent the environment was excellent and the service was excellent!   Had such an enjoyable evening. If you are looking for flavorable  food this is the place. Everything had a unique flavor as if you cooked it yourself so fresh and light very pleasing   Looking forward to  going back</8>
<9>Great place for outdoor dining especially during COVID. They have a great outdoor space, they enforce the mask policy unless dining, and there is an emphasis on safety/cleanliness from the staff. I thought they had a great drink menu and happy hour menu, with lots of great food options. Overall great experience!</9>
<10>So glad that they are open right now- they're offering both takeout and outdoor dining (but no delivery). The Porch has always been a staple restaurant for brunch/late night runs with my friends. In particular though, their Bianca pizza is my absolute FAVORITE pizza- I look forward to this pizza whenever I go to Pittsburgh. The combination of fig jam, truffle, goat cheese arugula is so delicious! ( Tip: ask for extra arugula! :) )</10>
<11>Amazing food and staff.  Even during trying times they made it amazing.  I would say go for the brunch but it's all top notch and the seating and scene is fantastic.</11>
<12>30 minute wait for an evening around 7. I ordered the veggie burger but found the patty to be a little on the bland side. The sauces on it thought made it much better. The crispy taters were enough to make me full, but they are a side with the burger.</12>
<13>Food was excellent.  Margherita pizza snd wings were great! Quick service and no wait</13>
<14>Crab tots were delicious and hot. Great service and nice people. We had a wonderful waiter! Great atmosphere. Fast service and delicious food. But make sure to ask for a steak knife to go with your steak because butter knifes don't work too well. Great place to go with family and friends! Take this place into consideration and stop by!!!</14>
<15>This is one of my favorite brunch places on campus. I always find a time to eat at this spot whenever I come back to visit as an alumnus. There eggs Benedict is the best but I decided to change it up today with their homemade veggie. It's hard to find a good veggie burger and theirs is one of the best because it does not fall apart like a lot of others. Their crispy potatoes and curried ketchup are an amazing pairing with any entree. We shared a side of their cinnamon buns on cast iron which are warm and gooey and are perfect for about any occasion. Overall the service was great and the atmosphere was very warm and welcoming</15>
<16>The location is beautiful. In the park, very open, tons of natural light. Service was fantastic. There was a slight wait but it was Sunday brunch so that was to be expected. We ordered a variety of items. The Mediterranean pizza was phenomenal but the chicken tasted off to me. I peeled it off and enjoyed the pizza without it. They're huge too! My tots were incredible. I'm not a big ketchup fan but their homemade ketchup was yummy. My bacon was fatty and undercooked. Could be my fault since I didn't specify but I didn't eat it. It's a crammed spot. I felt slightly on top of the other guests. And the tables are small so if you get 2 pizzas good luck fitting the rest of your food. All in all a decent brunch spot but not a favorite.</16>
<17>My friend and I stopped here for brunch on Sunday yesterday 8/11/19 and it was my first time here. I would say the only cons that we experienced were that it can be difficult to find parking and our waitress wasn't very attentive to our table (however I wouldn't penalize a rating for one person). They also ran out of almond milk so that sort of stunk for the drinks we initially wanted.We sat outside and were seated right away, just beat the rush as it soon became busy. We were very hungry: ordered the cinnamon roll as an appetizer to split, the breakfast pizza to split, the eggs benedict with shrimp, and the burrito (mostly pictured in my added photos to this review). They were all quite delicious however the portions are pretty large for me and we had a lot of leftovers. The pizza wasn't my favorite but it was different. The burrito I ate the other half for breakfast the next day (today!).I didn't take a photo of the menu, regrettably, but I thought it was sort of limited for breakfast/lunch however the restaurant isn't all that big either so it is expected. I really like the location despite the parking issue as you're in the center of Pitt's campus and it is just a beautiful location to sit outside and get a nice view of Oakland/enjoy the outdoor area. I would go again to try more options! The prices are reasonable and everyone there seemed pleasant.</17>
<18>I have been to this Porch location several times. The food is always good. I don't think I have ever ordered a bad meal. My 3 stars is based solely on the fact that it takes FOREVER to get your food. You order at the front, take a number and wait...and wait...and wait. Oy! Make sure you have a lot of time on your hands if you are coming here. Yesterday I ordered a tuna melt with side salad. I seriously do not think it should take 25 to 30 minutes to come out??? But hey it was an excellent tuna melt so it made my time worth it.</18>
<19>We got a make-at-home kit which included ingredients for a salad and ingredients for peach cobbler. The salad dressing went together well and it was fun making it. As we enjoy making our own salad dressings, I enjoyed using their recipe to make the dressing. Their salad ingredients were fresh. I improved the salad a lot by adding my own fresh cherry tomatoes and some fresh basil from my garden. Otherwise it would have been a fairly pedestrian salad. The peaches for the peach cobbler were s little hard and not quite as flavorful as the peaches I have been getting from the peach truck. The peaches I got from the Porch probably would have been better if allowed to ripen a few days. The cobbler turned out nicely warm and crispy. It would have been better with the addition of some cinnamon and a touch of nutmeg. However since I was making it for a Yelp elite event I wanted to follow the directions sent by the Porch. The Porch restaurant is a pleasant place. It has plenty of outdoor seating which allows people to eat while sitting spaced apart. The staff were wearing masks and using gloves.</19>
<20>As has been noted in many of my reviews, I'm a sucker for any brunch place with lightly dressed salads and coffee accompanied by little cream pitchers. Needless to say, this place fit the bill. I tried the breakfast sandwich with the side salad and my partner tried the grilled chicken BLT with the crispy taters. The breakfast sandwich had a great flavor - though the bread was on the cusp of crusty-bread-that-hurts-your-mouth syndrome. My partner enjoyed the BLT but the "crispy" taters weren't much to write home about. With that said, the service was great and the ambiance perfectly satisfied that brunch appetite.</20>
<21>We were so exited to have a great night.  It was a really hot day, we arrived little before 5 PM yesterday Friday the 24th. We said hi to the woman at the front,  as we approached the door; she replied rudely "how many"! She then took us towards a little table in the blasting sun.  I asked her if we could seat by the shade. There were a lot (they don't take reservations) of empty tables; with plenty of space for social distance. She proceeds to a table with 15% shade. Again in the blazing heat. Then the waitress comes with an attitude that was even worse, a nasty woman that should've never been allowed to have a job that requires interactions with humans. Honestly there are so many people that need jobs that deserve them that would be happy to work. She then drops the menus and water; she says "You can't order drinks without food" or stay and drink" we clearly told her we were there to dine!!! Not to get drunk"" she almost ruined our night. Seriously do not go this this place when these women are there.</21>
<22>Hi Ariel,Thank you so much for bringing this to our attention. We're so sorry to hear that you were disappointed with the service at The Porch. We will certainly follow up with our management team and would love the opportunity to follow up with you. Would you mind filling out our feedback form?dineattheporch.com/foote…</22>

<1>This was my last visited place while in Pittsburgh and what a way to go out. Came in here and it is chocolate heavan. Basically they have all types of fudge, chocolate covered stuff and chocolate candies. I had the peanut butter cracker and Oreo both chocolate covered (both were pretty damn good) but the peanut butter chocolate covered pretzel was simply great and amazing and just on another level. As for the milkshakes: they have about 20-25 different types and about 7 different sundaes, so plenty of selections in that department. I went with the banana foster shake and man again simple greatness and probably one of the best milkshakes I had in life. Just like having some good ole banana pudding is what the banana foster is to me. This is a must try place while in Pittsburgh.</1>
<2>The fluffy guy behind the counter was a DB and very rude.  The milkshakes weren't that great either.  Not sure if the dude was just in a bad mood but the milkshake was too slushy and didn't taste good.</2>
<3>Their milkshakes bring all the boys to the yard...  For real!  They do!  so delicious!  My trusty sidekick and I split The Chocolatier milkshake which is a chocolate shake with brownies, hot fudge, and chocolate chips, topped with whipped cream and a signature piece of chocolate.  So. Dang. Good.  And not only do they have awesome milkshakes but they have tons of other goodies including super friendly employees that seem unnaturally happy to help you!  I'm not complaining especially when they give you free samples :-)This is a must visit If you've never been.  Also, they apparently have the ingredients to make milkshakes for lactose intolerant folks (which I am not but figure it would be helpful info for people who are).</3>
<4>Oh my gosh. If you haven't been here, stop what you're doing and go immediately. I had to stop here when I was in Pittsburgh for the evening because I saw they had dairy free milkshakes. I got cookies and cream, and I was blown away by how thick and creamy the milkshake was! It was the perfect amount of sweetness too. It was truly iconic</4>
<5>The Milk Shake Factory is ALWAYS a great idea. Hands down, literally the best milk shakes I've ever had! It's a bit pricey, but they are definitely worth it. Also, they're pretty quick with making the shakes, so  I've never had a long wait.</5>
<6>Friendly and helpful staff.We asked a billion questions and they explained all the different flavors to us. We were also given samples of thier chocolate. On a Saturday afternoon there was no wait.</6>
<7>Milk Shake Factory is my go to when I have a sweets crazing in the southside.The interior is so charming! It's very open and bright. I love the contrast of the red ceiling and white walls and floor. They have a great collection of different milkshakes you can order with three main tiers to their menu: Classic, signature, and gourmet. On the menu is also dairy free options which is awesome! I also recently found out that you can customize your shakes.I highly recommend the salted Carmel and chocolate raspberry truffle shakes.The staff here is always polite and friendly. They are very accommodating!If you're looking for a milkshake in the southside look no further than the Milkshake factory!</7>
<8>Went here when we went to downtown PA. I am a milkshake girl but not with brownies and bits of things in them. It tasted good but it wasn't my favorite thing in the world . I got the special since the penguins scored the night before a players shake was 1/2 off. It was about the company with our friends though. The manager was so sweet and of course, who doesn't like milkshakes?!</8>
<9>As I've gotten older, I've noticed dairy and I don't exactly get along.  So when my hubs suggested we stop at the Milkshake Factory for dessert, I got nervous.  As we selected our free sample of chocolate peppermint bark I noticed something delightful: Dairy Free options!!!!  *Commence Happy Dance*I ordered a dairy free coffee milkshake with the expectation that it will not be as tasty as a true dairy milkshake.  Oh boy I was wrong!  First the coffee flavor will probably keep me up a bit later than planned, but well worth it!  Rich in flavor and creamy in consistency, I had to ask how this was dairy free.  I was informed it's soy ice cream with almond milk and coffee syrup.  Apparently their soy ice cream is better than what I've bought before...I'm super excited to have a place with delicious dairy free options!  Now when I want a milkshake, I know where I can go and not have tummy issues.</9>
<10>I walk in and feel like I gain 10lbs... but I'm ok with it :)  With the aroma of chocolate and the sound of blenders in the air, this is a sweet spot in the heart of SouthSide.  Whether you're in the mood for creamy chocolaty delights from Edward Marc Chocolatier or you'd prefer an indulgent treat in the form of a milkshake, next time you're in SouthSide, stop in for a treat.</10>
<11>Love it, shakes are amazing, chocolate strawberries fantastic, got chocolate is good too</11>
<12>Vegan friendly milk shakes, yeee haw!!! First, let's talk about how friendly the staff is, I obviously wanted to try every flavor they had to offer of their vegan friendly milkshakes, but sadly I couldn't. I ended up going with the chocolate raspberry truffle, which is something I typically wouldn't pick. They were just so convincing and boy were they spot on! It was deeeee-liciousssss, is a large size an option? The store front is super clean and crisp. The restrooms are also super clean and well kept. I have been here only a handful of times (which is probably for the best because it's so amazing), but I just love it so much!</12>
<13>Employees are rude Won't go back Seriously your serving over priced ice cream  do it with a smile and give the customer a happy experience</13>
<14>This long-standing location is iconic with the South Side. I've been coming to this spot since the heyday of the South Side 90s.As with my previous reviews for other locations, everything here is always tasty and fresh.They really do have a way with the milkshake.I don't get over here as often as I'd like but I'm thankful to be closer to other locations.</14>
<15>The shakers are great maybe a little expensive but fresh ingredients and I really like the decor always clean and well lit. I always get the large strawberry and cream for about $6 it's excellent..</15>
<16>Quality quality quality !! I highly recommend their milk shakes and/ or their chocolates. The people are friendly and helpful and the taste is top notch. Good place to get gift Chocolates for Valentine's Day or just because.</16>
<17>Stop in for the first time to try something for dessert after dinner, we shared a Stroopwafel Sundae! Oh my goodness it was so delicious! It is big enough for 2 people to share. They also have a huge selection of chocolates and Milk Shakes too. The place is extremely clean and very good staff. I highly recommend The Milk Shake Factory</17>
<18>Disappointed in my visit to the Southside Milk Shake Factory. I'm not a big milk shake fan but stopped with some guests who wanted to get some ice cream. I was disappointed that they really only have two flavors of ice cream now, vanilla and chocolate. I had heard so much about the Rivendale Farms ice cream, the cost of the cows, the loving milking techniques,etc., that I hoped for the best ice cream ever. It wasn't. It was icy, crunchy and very mildly flavored. It was a waste of calories. So disappointed.</18>
<19>Love the milkshakes - we went in after a long time on a Wednesday expecting their happy hour, sadly that is no longer a thing. I will miss the half price amazing milkshakes! I haven't had a shake there that I haven't liked.</19>
<20>This is one of my absolute favorite places to grab a sweet treat in the South Side. As the name suggests, milkshakes are the staple of this business' menu. Their thick and tasty shake options range from ordinary chocolate to gourmet (and often seasonal) specialties. Dairy-free shakes are also available, and there are sundaes for those who want to take their indulgence to the next level. To date though I've really only gone for the shakes because when they're THIS good and there's always a new flavor or two, it's hard to move on to try other desserts!By the way, while the name suggests that ice cream is all the place has to offer, that's just not so. There are also boxes of chocolates waiting and ready to go home with you, as well as various pieces of chocolate on display and ready for purchasing at their counter. Both are potential options if you're not quite up for a giant serving of ice cream, and the boxed chocolate is great for sharing (or not!) at home later on.A few additional notes of mine: seating is limited here compared to the downtown location, but since a lot of people opt to enjoy their dessert on the go, this hasn't been a problem during my visits. Like their downtown counterpart their desserts are admittedly on the pricier side, but since I'm very rarely in the South Side I'm admittedly more willing to indulge when I'm nearby. And sadly, like their sister location, they're also overly reliant on to-go cups, even if you stay and enjoy your shake in-house. I always make sure I'm able to take mine home and recycle it before stopping by.Regardless, while I can't say I'm a frequent visitor here for various reasons, I definitely enjoy what this place has to offer when I do stop by. Next time you're in the South Side and looking to treat 'yo self, give the Milkshake Factory a try - even if you're not sure you want ice cream (it happens, I won't judge!), chances are good that you'll find something to satisfy your sweet tooth.</20>
<21>I've been here a few times. Most recently I came here with family since an out of town cousin said he wanted a milk shake. It isn't cheap, but it was a special occasion and the shakes were good and the ambiance was fantastic. Somehow it wasn't crowded like it's been each prior visit so we were able to sit at a table inside and drink our shakes.  Outside walking back to the parking lot was not pleasant. There was a group of miscreants sitting on the stoop of a closed business harassing people walking by.  I know this is Carson St but still.</21>

<title>Robert Wholey and Co Fish Market</title>

<reviews>
<1>I've been visiting Wholeys for decades, starting back when the Strip was exactly what it started out as: a collection of wholesale businesses. I've always loved it; always will.My kudos goes out to 'D', the African-American doorman making sure customers are wearing masks. A blind customer came to Wholeys today, and D guided him through the store, stopping where the customer wanted to go and helping him get what he needed. That's not part of his job description, but D was incredibly kind to this customer, who was a regular. I told the manager how impressed I was with D, and it also makes Wholey's look good that they hired a man of this caliber.</1>
<2>Ask a yinzer where to get a fish sandwich in Pittsburgh and they will probably tell you "Wholey's dahn in the strip". I love their shrimp hoagie. That chipotle remoulade they use is so good. The cod sandwich is so big I usually end up taking some home with me (if I can wrap it in time before my husband tries to devour it). They always give a healthy serving of fries and their lobster Mac is so yummy. I like to grab a little container of cole slaw from their fridge and put it on my fish sandwich.The dining area upstairs is always clean and I love the variety of sauce options. P.S. - if you haven't tried the Vidalia onion and peach hot sauce... you're missing out. They have it upstairs sometimes at the condiment bar and also sell it downstairs. That sauce has become a staple in our house. I dip everything in it! Fish, fries, chicken, roasted veggies. It's addicting! I bring my parents here when they visit from out of town because they love to see the Wholey's atmosphere (and food).</2>
<3>Stopped in after shopping the other stores with sister and her hubby. They were looking for specific seafood items. While there, I couldn't pass up the bargain on these beautiful portobello mushrooms.  $4.19 for three beautiful.</3>
<4>On Sunday I came in with my host and I got in line to order seafood I remember asking for an order of greens collard greens I then ordered three crabcakes ( I focus on these specifically ) two soft shell crabs and an order of smelts All seafood was breaded and fried and the person doing the front had a jovial attitudeFirst I never received the collard greens I don't know if I was charge for them but when I came in later to try to ask for an order to be delivered the line was really too long so I let it goSecond smelts We're under read it in overcook to the point they had that less than pleasant fishy aroma and taste I took a bite out of one fish and then threw the rest awaySecond the softshell crabs for a real soft shell crabs but they had a less than pleasant taste or almost chewy like being under done I come from sea coast city Baltimore and I catch crabs in the Chesapeake Bay recreationally so I'm quite aware with crab should taste likeNow for the big issue the crabcakes weren't crabcakes they may have had some crab meat in it but everything was finally puréed in medication as it sounded like with some people policy food cake it could be a healthy dose of ground up whiting I have certainly had what some people Paul crabcakes and other places that turned out to be seafood cakes I were three of them ate one and threw the other two awayNow my hosts suggest a time might have been better off getting the codfish it should I be in town I think that's the way I go but right now I think your food is pretty poor</4>
<5>Best place to get decent fresh seafood. Live lobsters are decent size and sweet too. If you enjoy fish heads, there's a good selection of red snappers, salmon, halibut and etc. They're approximately $2 per lb.</5>
<6>Was recommended by the locals and definitely did not disappoint!! Best fish  sandwich ever!! Awesome  macaroni and  cheese!! My friend enjoyed the shrimp  po boy!!! Great spot on the strip district!!!</6>
<7>I mail ordered 40 pounds of frozen 16-20 Texas wild shrimp. It was packaged perfectly and arrived frozen solid and promptly. Unfortunately the shrimp tasted like bleach. The raw shrimp smelled like bleach slightly. We sautéed, BBQd and baked the shrimp and every time bleach could be tasted even when we tried to mask with spices or curry. I contacted the company and emailed back and forth with Tony. As a business owner myself I felt he should know an inferior product was being sold. He was very surprised to hear of the issue and asked that we open another bag of shrimp which we did, then another. Each bag had the same issue. I emailed him back and he never responded. Upon further research I've learned it's common to douse seafood with bleach as it's starting to spoil to clear up the fishy smell.That was $450 down the drain!</7>
<8>This place is a Pittsburgh institution. If you haven't noticed, Pittsburgh isn't near an ocean. This is probably the best fresh seafood you'll get in the area.While they have a wonderful selection of fresh stuff, there's also something to be said for the readymade foods and sandwiches.I got a heavenly crab cake sammie on Mancini's bread last time I was here, and I will now probably get one every time I'm in the Strip. It's only $7 too.Even just thinking about it, I kinda just wanna go and get one right now.But you really can't go wrong with the food. All of it is great! Plus there's a giant seating area upstairs where you can eat and marvel over all of your finds from other stores.</8>
<9>Like many Pittsburgh natives I've been coming here all of my life.Obviously the best and only place for the freshest seafood and freshest cuts of meats and deli items.Lots of stuff can be found here that you can't get anywhere else.However to use Wholey's as a grocery store would be foolish because many of their staple items are overpriced and you'd fare better at Aldi. Again, with that said, this place has always been on it for the seafood.It's exactly the type of place you'd expect to find in bigger cities and I'm happy we've got them!</9>
<10>Fish heads, fish heads, rolley polley fish heads....... And when I went in, there they were... a bucket of smelly FISH HEADS! After eating lunch at their restaurant I decided to go to their fish market that was having a 100 year celebration! When I walked in they gave me some birthday cake on a card and told me to turn the card over when I was done inhaling my cake. LO AND BEHOLD I WON A 10 DOLLAR GIFT CARD!I walked around and looked at the smelly fish tanks, fish heads, lobsters, singing pigs and popcorn. I tried some samples and bought some snacks to use at the drive in later that night.It was a fun smelly day!</10>
<11>Quality price selection... Wholey's gets it. Professional specialists. Butchers. Fish & Seafood. They even have staples, fresh fruit and veggies, bread, you name it. Plus the parking, you can't go wrong</11>
<12>Wholey is a Strip District classic, and it's not hard to see why with their delicious fish sandwich. During our Saturday errands, we stopped in to split an oyster po' boy and a cod sandwich. Because its Wholey's anniversary, we got free chips. The oyster po' boy was great, but some bites were chewy and a little off-putting. The cod sandwich was terrific. The chips were good, but inconsistently seasoned so you get one bite that's bland and another that's super salty. Old bay is the secret to tastier chips. The fish market itself can be hit and miss though. We've gotten excellent fish and fish that was off after a day.</12>
<13>This is my kinda place!Fish market, meat market with produce, dry goods, everything you need to feed.The service counter for food moves quick and be ready to order as they are ready to cook. Its cafeteria style with the dining area on the second floor away from the hustle of the Went with fish sandwich with some pawns on the side and corn bread all very good and priced nicely.The dining area has all you need and more as far as condiment and is kept clean by a very attentive staff.</13>
<14>If you are looking for a spot to grab a HUGE fish sandwich, fries shrimp or delicious crab cake at low price then this is the place but almost everything is fried which is why my review is not a perfect five star review. I came here for lunch with four of my colleagues and we ordered everything from chicken wings to cod sandwich, shrimp, fries, crab cakes and slaw. Keep in mind this is a seafood market with a cafeteria style order station so don't expect waiters and white cloth on the table. They do put white paper sheet on the table if that makes you feel better ;). I wish this place would steam shrimp, crab legs or lobster. I would dine here more often if that was ever an option. BTW - There is a privately own sushi stand inside and everything I ever got from there was super delicious</14>
<15>So Jealous... wish a grocery store/fish market/meat market like this was in my area.  Could not believe the selection of fresh fish and seafood, especially since Pittsburgh is no where near either coast!  Honestly, I have never seen bigger lobsters or crab legs... not even in Seattle or Philly.  So many other great things, like squeezing your your fresh oranges or fresh lobster bisque samples.  Also free parking while you shop!</15>
<16>A Pittsburgh landmark, a huge fish market, a cafe, and a grocery. You should visit to buy fresh seafood or just to look around. It's lobster tanks and all variety of seafood. Sometimes there's an accordionist playing polka tunes outside on the weekend, and it all contributes to the sights and bustle. Whether you want a fish sandwich or sushi, the prices are reasonable, and it's fun to eat here.</16>
<17>What a wonderful market! Wholey's is a feast for the senses!  We love looking at all the amazing seafood - football-sized lobster tails and king crab legs the size of your forearm, among so much more - but Wholey also has great meat, poultry, produce, prepared foods, a seafood grill...and on and on.On one visit, Johnnie had a soft-shell crab sandwich that came with two crabs on it, and he enjoyed it immensely. The sushi looks good, is prepared in front of you, and you know the ingredients are fresh and high quality. The staff is friendly and helpful and they make it a great experience to browse and shop.Conclusion: Whether you're local and need fresh, quality items for your meals, or a tourist checking out the Strip District, Wholey's is a must.</17>
<18>If your in the strip district mostly on a weekend because there's lots of people milling around. They have been here forever and have the best fish sandwich around it's about $10 but it's huge. It reminds of a fish market by the ocean everything is super fresh. You need to stop in it's a Pittsburgh landmark plus free parking for customers across the street next to McDonald's</18>
<19>Awesome go to market for not only sea food but beef, pork, lamb and chicken. Lot if fixin's available.</19>
<20>In the strip District in Pittsburg you'll find this great market place. Only the freshest fish and meat you could find. I recommend the king crab, they are humongous!!! Also the ribs are delicious and everything is so fresh that I've ever bought from here  there's also a grocery store attached they are very reasonably priced & have very fresh vegetables.</20>

<title>National Aviary</title>
<description>The National Aviary is America's only independent indoor nonprofit zoo dedicated exclusively to birds. Located in West Park on Pittsburgh's historic North Side, the National Aviary's diverse collection comprises more than 500 birds representing more than 150 species from around the world, many of them threatened or endangered in the wild. 

The National Aviary's large walk-through exhibits create an experience unlike any other - an intimate, up-close interaction between visitors and free-flying birds, including opportunities to hand-feed and meet many species rarely found in zoos anywhere else in the world.…</description>
<reviews>
<1>Start your review of National Aviary.</1>
<2>I am so glad they are open again. We have been twice since they reopened. The employees and volunteers are knowledgeable and polite. You get to see a wide variety of large and small birds up close. They do a good job with natural appearing habitats for their birds. They do have some mammals such as the flying foxes (giant bats) and the elusive sloth. The penguins are a favorite particularly if you catch them doing their graceful underwater ballet. The tunnel observation areas are closed off due to Covid but since they limit the number of visitors, you have plenty of opportunities to see the penguins from different angles. We got to see the lorikeet feeding up close and we were the only visitors in the room</2>
<3>Really cool place, I think this is one of only 2 aviaries I've been to in my life. Favorite room was the wetlands, followed by the finch room. But the rest of the aviary was fantastic to see as well. This is definitely one of those museums that get better with patience. You can easily complete it in about 30 minutes if your goal is to see each room, but it's fun to just stand next to a railing and watch how the birds interact. Then you start to notice other birds hiding in the trees, on the pipes, in the corners, etc, and some will fly and land near you so you can experience a closer look. Very cool experience. Definitely exceeded my expectations.</3>
<4>Dang, Pittsburgh. I've gotta say, this is the coolest aviary that I have ever been to!  I didn't know much about this place at all before stepping in. I honestly just thought it was going to be like 4 or 5 birds in a small building. NOPE! This place is basically a mini zoo, with sooo many different types of birds to check out. Different habitats like the rain forest, colder and warmer climates.   The admission is $20, which is a good deal for how long you could probably spend here. You'll find different species like canaries, penguins..even toucans!! I'm not a huge bird person but I was fascinated at what I saw. The aviary is also very clean and well organized, so there are multiple rooms with birds that fit into the same category as one another.  If you're in Pittsburgh, this place is a must. It actually wasn't even a top priority during my visit, but was for sure a pleasant surprise!</4>
<5>When you drive a couple hours to visit cause the website said it's open but then it says 'closed today' on a sign out front  when you get there.</5>
<6>I've been here a few times now since moving to Pittsburgh and I've been equally impressed each time I come. The penguin exhibit alone is enough to make you want to keep visiting. There is even a crawl space in which you can get up close and personal - and interactive! - with penguins through glass containments. Other areas feature exhibit exotic birds, more recently flamingos as the special event. They also typically have an interactive bird show that I highly recommend attending. Make sure to pay attention to special feeding and training times to appreciate a more lively experience!</6>
<7>We hadn't been to the aviary in years. I don't know why we waited so long. We set up a private penguin feeding but that was cancelled due to weather.  We hung out until our owl encounter, which was fantastic.  We walked and watched and it was relaxing and enjoyable! We spent hours watching the birds and it was fantastic! Our owl encounter was with Cypress an eastern screech owl. She was beautiful!!! If you are ever looking for something to do in Pittsburgh, it's perfect for an afternoon of fun and education. We won't wait so long to go back!!!</7>
<8>Was surprised that we got thru all exhibits in about 45 minutes. We didn't purchase any add-on services just did general admission. They had staff in each area though which was nice. Be careful cause you might get pooped on from the flying birds! It was lovely seeing them chirp and communicate with one another.</8>
<9>The Aviary is a very cool place! Really enjoyed my visit here. We spent about an hour total to see everything and watch the penguin show. Being a member of the Cleveland Botanical Gardens got me free admission through the reciprocal admissions program, so I'd check any memberships you have for gardens, zoo's, etc to see if they are reciprocal.Parking was the only problem, they have a very small lot, and it fills up fast. It's in a very congested area where street parking is hard to find. We drove around for 20 minutes trying to find parking and ended up having to leave and get lunch before coming back to finally find a spot in the lot. It is $5 if you find one there.</9>
<10>We visited here and have a botanical garden membership that is reciprocal so our admission was free. But I would definitely pay to visit. This is a phenomenal experience for children and adults together.</10>
<11>The National Aviary is a blast! So many gorgeous, exotic birds to see. Lots of exhibits are interactive and there's lots of signs and staff to really educate you on avian life. It's always super crowded it seems. It's also fairly expensive. I enjoy walking through and my niece loves the penguin tunnels. The sloths are adorable!</11>
<12>Please know I am NOT a fan of birds, actually pretty terrified but had quite a fun afternoon (about 2 hours or less) at the aviary.  Very clean and organized. It does smell like birds, but it obviously should. The birds do come near you and fly overhead but even I enjoyed it. It's also a great place to go on a rainy day.  There is a snack bar/food area which we did not visit and a gift shop.  Great for all ages! Stroller and wheelchair friendly and you can hang up your coat and umbrella</12>
<13>To get the most out of our experience we attended the show. In order to see different birds and animals I do recommend this, it was professional and well put together. Seating is limited and the best seats are in front so you want to be there early. Tickets can be purchased upon entry.I feel it could get a little pricey compared to Phipps but smaller. An example of pricing: 2 adults adding the 20 minute show was nearly $45. Special note: parking is free on Sunday.On positive side, I was in awe of the beautiful birds, many of which were in free flight among us.I'm glad we visited.</13>
<14>If you are a fan of birds at all, YOU HAVE TO GO TO THIS PLACE. You might have some concerns with how small the layout is relative to other aviaries, but there's no shortage of things to do. Starting half an hour after opening, they have events happening practically all the time, some of the more popular ones reoccurring during the day, so people who show up at different times don't have to worry about missing out.General admission is $17 for adults, and some events don't have extra charge whereas a few do (it usually involves you being able to be really close to the birds to feed them). Their exhibits also focus more around being interactive, or at least let us and the fellow flyers to co-exist without the need for a glass wall as much as they can allow.If you do decide to buy tickets for the more exclusive shows, keep in mind they have a bundling discount; you pay less per ticket when you get tickets for more events. I wasn't aware about this, paid $5 for the first event, then had to go back to pay $5 for another event. The staff being the wonderfully friendly and kind people they are remembered that I already bought tickets and applied the discount without me asking.What even are these events you're talking about, you ask? One branch of the aviary consists of the wetlands, grasslands, and (African) penguins. The wetlands hosts a feeding session where a staff member talks about the various species they have along with their particular diets. This gives them a good opportunity to ask up volunteers multiple times, each time to feed the birds with a unique kind of food in a unique manner (how it's unique you will have to attend to find out!).I didn't have the time to go feed canaries, but I did have time to feed the toucans instead. The way they do that one is to feature a few of these, directing each of us to feed it one hand at a time. As they present and educated us about these, it gives us a really good look at these birds acclimated to jumping onto our arms and eating away their fill.However, to me, the best event of them all has to be on their sky deck. This where we have unbound birds outside of captivity who are willing to showcase their flying skills for treats. If you're a fan of watching trained raptors or other birds of prey, this is also a must-see.By the way, they have flying foxes, just because they're AWESOME.</14>
<15>Attended their annual Night in the Tropics event which was excellent as usual! A big fan of the place in general.</15>
<16>The aviary is home to over 600 birds representing more than 200 species. It is a perfect size and it offers many extras that may thrill the kids. It was interesting how many birds can/must live together in what appears to be a harmony. Enjoyed sounds, colors and movements. You will not feel overwhelmed or threaten but you will be amazed by some species. Money spent well - memories etched for eternity.</16>
<17>This is probably one of my favorite spots in Pittsburgh! I'm a huge fan of birds so take my words with that in mind.The Aviary has a wide collection of birds organized by environment. A few birds live outside of the main building, and they definitely catch your eye when you first walk up. I was amazed at the giant candors on their perch, watching the visitors as they approach. A few large owls also live outside.Inside the wetlands, parrots, pheasants, and even a sloth lives in this leafy environment! The caretakers were very knowledgeable and helpful in answering my questions. They pointed out details such as how the small birds loved staying in the rafters at the top of the greenhouse, or how their sloth actually moved quite quickly when it was hungry. The aviary boasts a few more interactive exhibits such as protected glass platforms within the penguins habitat or walking into the parakeets(? I forget the exact bird) exhibit. The caretaker there told us the story of how smart the birds were, escaping the old mesh windows during the night and then running back into their cages when they saw people in the morning. Overall, I learned a lot from my experience at the aviary and would definitely come here again. I thoroughly enjoyed my visit. My advice is to talk to the caretakers as they share great insights into the lives of these birds!</17>
<18>Wow - just wow! This far exceeded all my expectations. This is not a simple, zoo-like aviary. There are two whole rooms where visitors follow a path surrounded on both sides by a lush, tropical setting. In those two rooms there are no cages and the birds roam free - sometimes coming up really close! Seeing them in flight and watching them interact in a close-to-natural environment is amazing. The birds seem really healthy and happy here.There are more traditional enclosures, too. Watching the penguins is really fun and there is a tunnel for kids to get closer to them. And I would recommend splurging on a bird feeding. I did the lorikeet one and it was so much fun! The birds are fearless and friendly, and the staff welcoming and knowledgeable. If you're in Pittsburgh do not miss out! Visit the aviary!</18>
<19>They really know how to get you in the door, just keep bringing in adorable baby animals! I swear there's a new baby sloth every year, and I'm totally okay with that! But not only was there a baby sloth, but a baby penguin and baby flamingos. Seriously, cuteness overload!I like that they offer a lot of programming where you can get up close and personal with the animals. They have a staff member come out with a specific animal and talk about it. I think that's a smart move because it's interactive and engaging. It's not a very big venue, so the programming helps draw people in.I was sad to see that the rainforest portion was closed for renovations. I believe it just started and is going through July. I'm excited to see what improvements have been made, because that is my favorite part of the aviary. Can't wait to also keep coming back with my son, I'm sure he'll just keep getting more interested as he gets older. Throw in some new baby animals and we're sold!</19>
<20>After seeing the movie "The Birds" I never really had the desire to go to here because I thought somehow I would be attacked if I went there.  Well, I had to face my fears when I had a meeting scheduled there!  I reluctantly went, but my mind was changed very  quickly!  We received a personal tour and it ended up being pretty cool!  It's really awesome to be able to walk into a room with tons of colorful and interesting looking of birds flying around you.  I must admit, I did have to duck and run a couple of times for fear of getting pooped on!  But thankfully there were no close calls.  There's a really beautiful room with a pond and lots of birds literally walking around you.  Of course, the best thing to see here are the penguins.  They're just so fun to watch waddling around!  You definitely need to go!</20>
<21>I had so much fun at the National Aviary. This was my first visit. I went on a Saturday morning around 11am. The best part was hanging out in the enclosures with the birds. In the Grasslands, you are surrounded by little birds. They chirp and sing, fly around you, build nests...I could watch for hours. The Wetlands is another open area with a large pond. Ducks and flamingos hang out in the pond...birds fly around and call to each other. Again, I could watch for hours. Other enclosures include eagles, owls, condors, penguins, butterflies, bats, and canaries. The sloth was taking a nap when we stopped by.Few notes: The Tropical Rainforest was being renovated at the time of my visit. There is a small parking lot and street parking when the lot fills up. Entry for 1 adult is $16.I'm really looking forward to my next visit to the National Aviary!</21>
<22>So very, very glad we took time out of our trip to see the Aviary.  Though a bit pricey, we thoroughly enjoyed the two hours we spent amongst our winged friends. The Aviary is centrally located in Pittsburgh in the central park.  You need not even pay to see several exhibits like the Condors.  Once inside they have several different rooms, Savannah, rain forest, and marsh provided a nice variety.  They had Penguins, and sea birds too. You are right with the birds and interactions are frequent.  We got to see a very fun feeding session, but we missed the theater and didn't eat at the cafe.  I think the photos will do it justice. If you love birds as much as I do, definitely visit the National Aviary.</22>

<title>Dancing Crab Thai Noodle House</title>
<description>thai street food…</description>
<reviews>
<1>Finally got around to ordering takeout from here after a failed in person attempt when they first opened.  I was pleasantly surprised!  The food was ready quickly and was delicious.  Got crab rangoons which have a unique flavor here, maybe a bit of curry? Delish! Green curry with chicken was awesome and great portion size.  Pad Thai with shrimp was also delicious, but the shrimp to noodle ratio was very off and that was a bit disappointing.  Like many Thai restaurants, they are no joke with the spice levels so I might go a bit down from my normal spice number Would definitely order takeout from here again!</1>
<2>Total disappointment.  The service was nonexistent... we stopped in around 830 in a Friday night.  No one greeted us.  We had to walk back to the very back to be seated, and had to keep walking back to the back to get water, to order food, etc.  After 45 mins of waiting for our appetizers, we tracked down the waiter to cancel our order.  Super bummed to have this terrible experience in my neighborhood, I'll try again in a month or so.</2>
<3>This is one of my favourite places to dine while visiting Pittsburgh.  My partner always gets pad thai and I usually get duck curry.  Both are amazing. The portions  are generous and the food is freshly made!  I've found this be be consistent between dine-in and takeout.The bao buns are solid. They may not be the best ones I've had but they're still really fresh and tasty.I've also tried the noodles and cabbage and it's worth trying if you've not had before, albeit a bit greasy.The restaurant is always clean and the service from the owner is impeccable.The restaurant is accessible for those with mobility devices with the caveat that you have to pull the restroom door open to exit, and it has a high on the wall hand dryer, so one might want to bring a napkin or handkerchief.The only trouble I've ever had at the restaurant is that the dining room is a medium size one (rather large for the area) and if other guests are noisy it carries.</3>
<4>I've mostly ordered takeout from this place since COVID but I also sat inside once. I love the food here and the staff is also always helpful when I need to make something vegan. My go to is the green curry with tofu but everything I've tried has been delicious. I think it is probably the best Thai food I've had in Pittsburgh!</4>
<5>Drunken Noodles:I had a spice level of 4 and it was a little low on the spiciness level but it was my first time there. I'll definitely come back there again. I would rate the drunken noodles 8.4/10Pad Thai:My girlfriend had pad Thai with a spiciness level of 5 and she said it was good for her. The nuts on top of the pad Thai is a great addition and adds to the texture so well. I had some of hers and she rated it a 8.7/10Pulled Pork Bao Bun:This is an appetizer we had. I personally love bao buns and this was perfect. The pork tasted great and the addition of cucumber was fantastic. I rate it a 8.9/10 and my girlfriend gave it an 8.5/10. Overall, the restaurant is great and I would recommend it to ever  to one.</5>
<6>Definitely check this place out if you're looking for authentic Thai food! First time trying koa soy and it was delicious!! The curry that came with the noodles was very flavorful. The spice is on a scale of 1-10 and it was on the milder side so definitely go up on the spice level if you want it to be spicy. Would def come back again to try out other dishes. They also have free delivery!</6>
<7>The food was excellent. They have options for both eat in and take out. The night we were there, there was only one waitress but she was awesome! She hustled like crazy and took care of everybody.</7>
<8>From the outside It doesn't look like much but this place was great! Went on a date with my boyfriend and we ordered crab Rangoon, Tom yum soup, and two orders of drunken noodles! Everything was very good! My boyfriend said it was the best rangoons he's ever had lol!! Delicious Tom yum soup and man were the drunken noodles good! service was quick and friendly! Staff was so extremely nice and made It an even better experience! Will definitely be back! On spice: the spice level was pretty spicy for a the 4 I ordered! Just to know if you ever check this place out!</8>
<9>I stumbled across this restaurant when I was looking for a more traditional Thai menu, and I'm glad I did! I've never had pineapple fried rice this good anywhere. Also, the dumplings appetizer is magnif, as are the spring rolls. I've also enjoyed the chicken pad see ew as well as the drunken noodles, and they're among the best I've had anywhere.But I didn't so much enjoy the pad Thai. I had duck pad thai, and where the duck itself was delicious, there was some weird, cloyingly sweet sauce in the noodle portion. My wife, who had gotten a tofu version of the pad thai, had the same thing to say about her boodles. In fact she may have also referred to them as "cloyingly sweet." In fact I may have plagiarized that descriptor from her. Update: my wife is suing me for plagiarism, but Dancing Crab is still our go-to for Thai food! We just don't get any versions of the pad thai and we're all set!</9>
<10>Thank you for stopping by and giving us a try, Scott! We hope to see you again soon to explore more of our menu options. Best, Dancing Crab Thai Noodle House</10>
<11>If it has the word "Noodles" in it's name, you can bet that I am more than likely going to try the place out.  I went to Dancing Crab Thai Noodle House (not to be confused with Dancing Crab Too that is a few blocks away) for my Birthday dinner with my wife and daughter. The entrance is a little odd that you walk in and there is a bar on the left but it has no purpose.  You walk up a small ramp past the bar to the back of the restaurant and there is the seating area, with trendy wood and cool pictures on the walls.I had to try the Thai dumplings on the specials menu and they were great.  Went with the Drunken Lo Mein with Shrimp as an entrée and it was good.  I was asked how hot I wanted it on a scale of 1 to 10.  I am usually hesitant when asked this cause I have had instances where my idea of a 5 and the cook's idea of a 5 are pretty different, but I went with 5 none-the-less.  Frankly, I could have gone 8 or so with confidence, cause a 5 was not bad at all.  A little runny nose and spice, but it was more than manageable.My wife had the Crab Fried Rice which was good. She is not a huge fan of onions and this had a bunch of them, so she had to pick them out, which I then got to add to my dish as I love onions.All-in-all not too expensive of a dinner.  The place seems to do a lot of take out business, as there was a steady stream of people walking to the back where the counter was for to go orders.  Seems to be a favorite in the South Side community.</11>
<12>Thank you for taking the time to detail your experience, Eric! We are happy to hear that you enjoyed your dining experience. We hope to see you again in the near future. Best, Dancing Crab Thai Noodle House</12>
<13>Best Thai food!My boyfriend and I stopped here for an early dinner before catching a movie. Be warned- even on weekends they do close mid-day although the hours posted on the internet show it is open all day Saturday and Sunday. We arrived a few minutes before they re-opened at 4. No worries- there is a great beer store a couple store fronts away, so we shopped for some beers to bring to dinner (it is BYOB).We came back at 4 and were seated right away. My boyfriend and I both ordered drunken noodles and spring rolls to share. Fantastic Thai food! They sprinkle fried garlic on top- so good! They veggies seemed really fresh and I don't think they were frozen, which many Thai restaurants will use. Overall great food and service!</13>
<14>Ordered takeout during the whole coronavirus mess, and it made my day 10x better. Support this business if you can, she really deserves it. This experience puts it back to five stars, everything was up to par and delicious.</14>
<15>Thank you so much for supporting us and stay safe</15>
<16>So I had my first sort of negative experience here yesterday. Usually everything is on point, but it seems like everything was made almost too fast with no care. Everything we got was extremely greasy, there were some unusual smoky flavors in our food, the crab rangoons (which are usually incredible) tasted old and oily. I noticed the owner didn't make our meal because she was out, but whenever she makes it, it is always incredible! I'll be back again of course, but it's a shame if this place becomes inconsistent due to laziness in the kitchen. It really is a gem of a Thai restaurant, and I would hate to see it go downhill.</16>
<17>Delicious!!! Thai food is my favorite thing in the world, and I'm always hunting for the best spots to go to. This place is a 10/10 in my book! This was my 4th time going, and so far it has been consistent every time. The flavors are unique & delicious, and the service is always very quick. You can tell all of the food is homemade, even down to the crab rangoon (which I highly recommend). This time around I tried the pad thai, and it was SO delicious! The curry dishes are also amazing. I don't think many people know about this place yet, but it has become my new favorite Thai spot in South Side (and that is saying a lot).*Update* Brought my sister here tonight for her first time, and she loved it. She is just as much of a Thai food lover as I am, and she was equally impressed. I ordered the red curry noodle dish today, and it was such a big portion that I have another meal for tomorrow. We ordered the Thai dumplings this time too...delicious!!!</17>

<19>I ordered from DoorDash and my food never came. Nothing towards the restaurant at all, I've actually never even eaten here. I just never received my food.</19>
<20>I don’t think this s our fault. You should contract doordash because we make the order whatever is on doordash tablet but if doordash driver didn’t come to pick up food, there s nothing we can do.</20>
<21>Best thai in Pittsburgh. And yes, we've been to Nikki's Thai, Smiling Banana Leaf, noodle head, Thai me up, and Dancing Crap blows them out of the water. Are go to is Basil fried rice with chicken, green curry with chicken/tofu, and their dancing chicken appetizer! We get this about 2 times a month.</21>
<22>Thank you , we promise to keep up good work.</22>
<23>This restaurant is located in South Side and was a nice convenient stop for lunch. You get a lot for your money. the lunch deals are only during the week FYI. we all loved our meals. I got spice level and it was relatively tame, i could just taste a hint of spice. when i go back i'm gonna try a four. i don't typically order spicy food (i get a 1 at noodlehead for reference) so i think their scale of 0-10 isn't as spicy. i liked you got more vegetables with this dish versus other thai places. i liked how on yelp you get the 10% off! one use per table.</23>
<24>The Kai Soi here is the best ever, and I love the fried tofu appetizer. This spot is great for vegetarians and you can tell they put a lot of effort into their food. One of my favorite Thai places.</24>
<25>Note that this review is based solely on delivery as I have never ate in at the restaurant. I've ordered delivery through Grubhub right here on Yelp a few times and have been satisfied with my orders each time. I've tried the spring rolls, Tom yum soup, pineapple curry (once with tofu, once with chicken) as well as the massaman curry. I liked everything I've had from here. The pineapple curry is really flavorful. The most recent time I got it though, the curry was on the watery side but still good. The springs rolls are just your average spring rolls, nothing fancy or special. As for the Tom yum soup, delicious (but not as good as My Thai, which is my favorite in Pittsburgh). As for the massaman curry, pretty standard. Just a warning, I asked for it with no peanuts but found cashews in the sauce, which the menu doesn't mention.Overall, decent Thai food, nice menu selection and fair prices. I'd like to go to Dancing Crab & Thai Noodle House something to get the dine in experience.</25>
<26>Thank you for the review, Ashley! We are glad to hear that you enjoyed your meal. We look forward to your next order. Best, Dancing Crab Thai Noodle House</26>
<27>Grossly overpriced.Penang curry served with a spoonful of steamed rice.  $21 for a fried rice.  Will never again!!!!I don't know who you are Lek S but I don't lie !!!!My review is accurate and your response is testament to my review .</27>
<28>That impossible but thank for your business.</28>
<29>I have tried a few Thai places in Pittsburgh, but this is one of my favorites. The food was delicious and the service was great. The restaurant is divided into 2 separate rooms. The back room, where we sat, is a little bit fancier. It looked like the front room is only used when the back room gets full. We ordered the crispy tofu and fried calamari appetizers, which were delicious. The calamari was very tender. All of our entrees were delicious too. I got the pad Thai with "medium" spice, and it was pretty mild. The drunken noodles with level 7 spice were spicy, but not killer, and both dishes were some of the best Thai noodles I have had. Prices were slightly higher (around (11-20) for dinner, but still not crazy. Service was great too, so I would come here again without a doubt.</29>
<30>I ordered take out so i'll really only be commenting on the food in this review, which was outstanding.Chicken Pad Thai- 4.6/5Delicious. Rivals Noodlehead. Dancing Crab's version is a little on the saucier side. I'm used to pad Thai tamarind sauce being absorbed more into the noodles for a drier consistency so good thing the sauce was superb. This is classic and authentic Thai fare.</30>
<31>Thank you for the review, Pat. We are happy to hear that you enjoyed your meal. We look forward to your next order. Best, Dancing Crab Thai Noodle House</31>
<32>Dancing crab is the place to be. BYOB is Ana amazing option for college students during a time for COVID. Social Distancing in effect can't beat the atmosphere and great workers!</32>

<1>We are patrons during the COVID-19 outbreak so we only got take out. But the food we got - a roasted pork crepe with harissa (yum!) and the goat cheese french toast were equally delicious! I also got a latte; which was made fresh upon arrival as was spot on. The folks here are wonderfully sweet, and their place is very cute, with a pub-like atmosphere. I wish I could have eaten on site! There is a public parking lot directly adjacent so it is easy peasy to eat here. If you have an opportunity to eat here, do. The food has a traditional base with a modern flair, and they've done it up well. Worth it!</1>
<2>I just ordered for delivery and I was very impressed!  So delicious!  I recommend getting a savory and sweet crepe to enjoy. Generous fillings made me appreciate all the flavor combinations!  I will be ordering again soon!</2>
<3>I highly recommend. Even before they renovated, I loved this place. Fantastic service, and amazing food. There are dairy free and vegan options, and is the perfect place that will accommodate to almost anything you want. The interior is clean and beautifully decorated. 10/10!</3>
<4>Delicious spot to grab brunch! There can be a bit of a wait, but their crepes are delicious!I got the Tivoli which came with fresh mozzarella, cherry tomato, baby spinach, pesto and side salad. It was light and tasty. If you want something a little more heavy my friend got an omelette crepe. It's a crepe with an omelette on top.</4>
<5>Cool place and different options for breakfast.  We had the walnut French toast and the sabory crepe omelet.  Both cooked perfectly in a cute atmosphere, service was very good and restaurant was clean.   Would definitely go again.  I wish they had cappuccinos, lattes, and espressos but the food was excellent.</5>
<6>I'm always looking for new breakfast places and Cafe Moulin is perfect for when I have a craving for something sweet! I've been twice and both times I got the super belgium crepe, which is filled with cookie butter. It's so rich and tasty I couldn't even take a picture first because I had to dig in. Their coffee and lattes are okay, nothing to write home about. The star of the menu is definitely the variety of crepes. The atmosphere here is interesting. It's a cozy little basement with some French decor. I personally like it. It feels homey. It's always been busy each time I've gone but I've never had to wait since I've had a smaller party.</6>
<7>What's for brunch? (Sunday- January 19, 2020)Amsterdam French Toast Platter. It's French toast, Turkish sausage, eggs & maple syrup!! My drink was Nutella hot chocolate!! Yum!! Meal specs: The French toast isn't fantastic but not bad. It could have a little bit more vanilla, maybe, to add just a touch more taste. For me, it should be just a little hotter when served would help. It wasn't cold. It was warm. I ask for extra syrup. The turkey sausage is very good & different!! It's seems slightly smokey & slightly spicy. I like both!! The eggs aren't very tasty. It's bland.  You have to pay $1 for their spicy sauce. Some meals comes with it. I mix the hot sauce, take a piece of turkey sausage with the eggs & eat it altogether. Side note:It's nice that they have crepes (which I haven't tried)! But, they look good!! Also, they have fresh fruit that's good; that I've tried from my husband's meal. Drink specs:It's chocolate goodness. It's better than the Swiss brand!! Bon appétit!!!Pictures</7>
<8>Cafe Moulin is a little French-style establishment specializing in crepes. It's a nice space set below street level and the service was great. As with any establishment in that stretch of Shadyside, parking can be a hassle.You can choose sweet, savory, or omelette-style crepes and the menu also features a few other options like French toast. The portion sizes are more authentic and less American (meaning they're smaller than you'd see in other restaurants). While I can appreciate the authenticity, I also unabashedly love food and was wishing there were a few small side options to choose with my crepe. That said, the food was quite delicious and worth a look if you're craving a good brunch in the area.</8>
<9>How I had never been here is a complete mystery to me.Found it on Yelp while just looking around, and decided that it would be a great place to try. So, we had a nice Saturday lunch here and really loved it!The house was PACKED, but service was quick and food was delicious. Their crepes are super tasty! There's a ton of options, and you won't be sorry with any of them. I also liked how they serve a very tasty side salad with the crepe order - it complements the dish perfectly.Prices are very reasonable, staff is friendly, and food is delicious! The most difficult part is finding convenient parking! We'll be back!</9>
<10>I've been to Cafe Moulin a number of times, and I have enjoyed each experience. There is not a lot of seating, especially on Sunday afternoons (I guess this is a good indicator of how popular this place is), and the atmosphere is a bit dark and cramped. However, the food is always good. I usually order the Nutella crepe with bananas or the Super Belgium. This is a perfect spot to come for a quick brunch or dessert!</10>
<11>Wanted to find a cute place for breakfast on the fly and man did we find a gem. Cafe Moulin's staff was amazing. Very attentive & everything came out very fast. The best part was the food! Every bite was so good that I contemplated not sharing even just a small bite with my husband. Coffee was great, latte art was a nice touch. We definitely found our new breakfast spot and will come back soon!</11>
<12>I know it says it on the side of their building but literally #bestcrepesinpittsburgh is spot on the truth. Anytime I am in town whether I want something savory or sweet this is the place to go</12>
<13>I've been to Cafe Moulin several times and each time I've enjoyed my experience! The food is always amazing and the service does a great job checking up throughout your meal. One thing to take into consideration is seating. It's a small restaurant, so if you're with a group more than 2 you will most likely wait for a table. Plus you will not be seated until everyone is present. For me, I've only gone in groups of 2 and I've been seated within 5 minutes of arriving.</13>
<14>Got a caramel latte and it was amazing! Nice caramel flavor that didn't overpower the espresso. Cute little cafe, but minimal seating and did have a decent wait time.</14>
<15>Delicious brunch delivered via Doordash to hotel. The Posh sandwich (Avocado and egg on crusty bread was delish. My companion had the Nutella crepes. Peach-ginger hot green tea was a great wake-up.</15>
<16>Stopped in for lunch today after a nice girl's morning with one of my best friends. Parking is in paid lots or paid street spots. It's a small space so you might have to wait (not sure about opentable or yelp's app since we went on a random Monday morning).I got the lox toast and it was delicious. The salmon was smoky and the little tomatoes and spread were a nice touch. I wished the ciabatta was toasted more.For dessert (we ran the Pittsburgh Half Marathon yesterday and were rungry) I for the walnut st crepe. It was nutty, caramelly, buttery and topped with granola.</16>
<17>Don't let the unassuming exterior or dark-paneled interior deter you from trying out this humble brunch spot offering excellent food. They have a variety of sweet and savory crepes as well as French toast and paninis. You can even get an omelet inside a crepe! What I liked is that the wait was not long, service was fast, and perhaps best of all, the portions were appropriate. It was enough food to make you full but not stuffed, and of course it was all delicious going down. Our table had one Alaskan crepe (salmon!), one super Belgian crepe (all the fruit!), and two ham and Swiss crepes (with side salads!). Prices are good for what you get. Gender segregated bathrooms. Conversations can get noisy inside. Not wheelchair accessible inside, but maybe if you sat outside when the weather is warm enough.</17>
<18>Overall I would give Cafe Moulin 3.66 stars.  Two of the three dishes that I was able to try were 4 star dishes with the third being a solid 3 star dish.  The best was the walnut street french toast.  Creamy bri add a depth to the dish that is wonderfully mixed with walnuts, granola, and maple butter.I also enjoyed the bristol as a delicious savory crepe.  The bechamel with the avacado add a nice creaminess that is well balanced with tart goat gouda.The third item we had was the sofia savory crepe.  Overall we thought it had the potential to be really good but the meat was dry and over cooked as were the eggs.  The harissa sauce had the potential to provide needed moisture, but there just wasn't enough of it.</18>
<19>Well I love this place...Awesome breakfast and lunch cute cafe in SHADYSIDE. Very warm and inviting atmosphere with friendly service. The owner so kind , everything perfect.They have a delicious crèpes and french toaste.Of course!!! Highly recommend!!!</19>
<20>This is amazing place... because i enjoy crepes... My favorite halle berry and walnut street... yummy... caffe moulin is owner and servers very kind and friendly. My favorite servers nursulu and reyhan... they are smile happy and friendly I recommend everyone.Cafe moulin = delicious breakfast and lunch</20>
<21>Best crepes in Pittsburgh! Located in an amazing area with lots of street parking as well as public parking lots and garages. The service is absolutely amazing and the staff is very friendly and helpful. Coffee and tea here is to die for- strong and not overwhelmingly sweet.</21>

<1>Start your review of Senator John Heinz History Center.</1>
<2>One of the best museums I have been to in a long time. It literally has everything! They are currently running a special (I assume because of Covid?) your entry ticket gets you two days at the museum. Normally I would say one day is enough for any museum, but not here! It also includes free entry to the Fort Pitt Museum along the River. Great value for the price. I would definitely go back again!</2>
<3>Loved our visit here. I grew up in Pittsburgh was here for the opening ceremonies years ago; it was nice to visit again and take the littles. They don't remember much about Pittsburgh as we moved when they were young; it was nice to see through their eyes the history of Pittsburgh. We started by playing in the kids Burgh area which was great to get them involved and interested. This museum is great because it not only provides a ton of knowledge but provides interactive things for the young ones to engage and learn with. I loved all of the exhibits and especially the ones that were changing. I felt like a rock star when we were in the local high school section and my name was mentioned! We loved creating famous pieces of artwork and enjoyed dancing and singing with the props. The museum is definitely worth the visit; we spent four hours and it seemed like the perfect time. I especially loved the incentive to use the steps; each floor you could stamp tour card and once you hit all the floors you could trade your card in for a prize.</3>
<4>A terrific museum, very Pgh oriented, at the tip of the Strip district. There's a lot to see and examine, so plan on a long stop, or multiple visits to fully appreciate it all. There's also a very nice gift shop with books, shirts, artwork and other collectibles. I went today with my 13 yr old son (not our first visit, but it had been a couple years) and he thoroughly enjoyed it, as did I.A must stop when you have a day to spend in town.</4>
<5>Nice little museum on the history of Pittsburgh.  A lot more to this city than you realize.  Lots of interesting exhibits and historical facts.</5>
<6>I learned so much about ketchup!  The actual Heinz portion of the museum, however, is a minuscule amount that the museum has to offer.It's a Pittsburgh-proud museum, so basically everything will be heavily weighted towards showing how great Pittsburgh is.  I'm not complaining,  PGH is cool as cucumbers, but if you have something against PGH sports teams, you better keep clear of the sports exhibit.For me, the jewel was seeing Mr. Rogers artifacts.  I'm an atheist, but for Fred, I hope heaven exists.</6>
<7>Awesome place with tons of exhibits and they have a sports museum, Heinz ketchup center, lots more one of the coolest places to visit in Pittsburgh.</7>
<8>Highly encourage you to go here at least once I your life time and you definitely be back.  Great place to go to remember our great city's history!  The staff is so friendly and helpful - if you have questions they go the extra mile to share what they do - how they preserve items and what it takes to plan and out I. The displays you see there. We got to see the newest display that just opened in the 16th - the Christmas display.  I have to say the items from Kaufmann's brought back so many memories of when my mom would take us downtown at Christmas to shop and see Santa in Santa Land - bravo History Center for that display.  There is a small snack bar if you get hungry as you explore the many floors and a nice gift shop if unique finds Have fun exploring and reminiscing about our great city's history.</8>
<9>We've seen the mustard museum twice but my son and I are ketchup fanatics.   We had to learn some history about our favorite condiment!This is a really nice museum with quite a lot to see - six floors!  We only went to the fourth floor to see the history of Heinz.  They also had a special exhibit of Mister Rogers Neighborhood which we checked out,  too.  I really liked the exhibits, but I thought they could have had more interactive stations so it wasn't just reading panel after panel of history.  My husband didn't think the displays were marked well enough, but he did like the area on the fourth floor with the big window so we could watch the restorations (I assume that's what it's for!).I would really recommend allowing a full day if you're hoping to see everything.  We spent close to two hours just looking at the vehicles on the first floor and walking around the fourth floor. The store is a little cramped, but they have a really nice bookshop that's worth a look. We would definitely return to the museum next time we visit Pittsburgh. ** Parking - There is good information on their website about where to park. The lot directly across the street was full, so we pulled into a lot next door. That was cash only ($10) but we didn't have enough cash on us! The attendant pointed us in the direction of a ramp two blocks away and we ended up spending only $5.</9>
<10>This museum is HUGE! And filled with a variety of exhibits guaranteeing everyone in your group will find something they like. They have an awesome exhibit of famous inventions and people from Pittsburgh. There's a sports museum with interactive displays and a wealth of information about any and all sports. My personal favorite tends to be the traveling exhibit. The History Center gets some truly incredible exhibits to visit here. Anytime I have gone, it's been fairly crowded. It's also pricey if you don't have a membership. But you can spend hours here and still not see it all, so I would say it's worth the extra cash.</10>
<11>Found this place on our Hop On Hop Off tour, and even though we only stayed for an hour, the sights did not disappoint.Museum does a nice job of incorporating a wide variety of exhibit types and provides lots of ways for younger visitors to engage with content. I was particularly impressed with the station at the end of the Vietnam exhibit that allowed visitors to express their feelings in writing. More museums should do that.Overall, a great place to visit. Only complaint is that directional signage was a smidge confusing in a few places (we got a little lost at one point). Highly recommend looking for coupons to make your visit slightly cheaper -- we found one that was a BOGO.</11>
<12>This museum was surprising.  I thought I was going to learn about the history of the Heinz Co. but it turned out to be so much more!!!First, I walked through the history of Pittsburgh exhibit. Anyone who is visiting Pittsburgh and goes to this exhibit will see Pittsburgh in a new light.   This blue collar city, has played an important part of American History.  I don't want to spoil anyone's experience so I decided to just list a few of the exhibits. 1. How Pittsburgh came to be2. Pre-revolutionary battles3. Slavery and black history4. Steamboats5. Coal Mining 6. Glass making 7.  Famous people such as the Mellon Family and Andrew Carnegie 8. Contributions to Medicine 9. Inventions and products made in Pittsburgh 10. The star of the show Heinz KetchupAs a bonus, your admission to the museum includes admission to the Sports History section to the museum.  Nicely done!</12>
<13>Was blown away with the amount of artifacts and displays that they have. The staff were nice and the facility was clean. They have a few floors of exhibits with stairs or elevators to access. They also have kid friendly areas as well for more engagement.</13>
<14>Great place to spend a few hours learning about the history of Pittsburgh. Each floor and room is filled with historical objects big and small, and curated in such a way that walks you through the evolution of the city and area.On this occasion, we spent the morning exploring the traveling Apollo 11 exhibit. Our family enjoyed the interactive pieces and learning about Pittsburgh's tie in to the space program.</14>
<15>While I loved pretty much every experience in Pittsburgh, the Heinz History Center went well beyond expectations. An affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution, this is the largest history museum in Pennsylvania. I recommend heading straight up to the top level where the world of Mr. Rogers is re-created. It isn't a huge display -- but you'll find some of the the show's most iconic sets and puppets on display. It will bring you back to your childhood.The History Center features six floors of permanent and changing exhibitions that tell the story of Western Pennsylvania. It can be overwhelming, but we skipped over the entire section on sports. One of the newest exhibits, and my personal favorite, was the history of the Heinz company. While its known for its ketchup, the company expanded internationally with a wide range of product lines.One thing is certain - you can't separate the Heinz company from Pittsburgh. And founder H.J. Heinz was a master marketer. He introduced the famous pickle charm at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893, making the pickle pin one of the most famous promotional pieces of all time.</15>
<16>I absolutly loved the museum.I have been saying I would go for months now and finally had the time.My favorite was the prohabition section which was really great and definitely a worth see.I also loved the actual Heinz Ketchup & other Products section which was really cool.I did not realize Heinz had made a lot of the products that where there.I loved the pyramid of ketchup bottles all put together to make one huge ketchup bottle.Wife and I did a yearly family membership as we can go over and over.I found the 5 floors of memorabilia super interesting and I would definitely go over and over again as I know i definitely missed things.If in the area I definitely suggest the Heinz history museum as it is great.</16>
<17>Home of the Heinz ketchup. Lots to learned from the history of everyone favorite condiment. Plenty to see in all floors. They have a special exhibit of Mister Rogers' neighborhood with artifacts of the show including the castle. Museum has interactive stations for all ages. The sports floor was fantastic with so much history and displays. Pittsburgh has so great history and the museum displays it well.</17>
<18>I always enjoy coming here for my history fix every once in a while. The latest exhibit I saw was the Apollo 11 exhibit. There was a lot of information on the astronauts and the ship. I had no idea Pittsburgh was so involved in the Apollo 11 mission! I love how the museum changes the exhibits frequently.  The staff is always so helpful and friendly. They are full of knowledge. So, if you see one, always feel free to ask them questions to get more information! The other floors are full of great history as well. Some of my favorites are the Lewis and Clark section and the Sports history section. There's also so much for kids to do. My 18 month old niece had a great time sliding down the slide, building blocks, and sitting in things that were permitted. My parents also always enjoy coming to the museum to see the different exhibits. They have everything for people young and old. My brother and sister in law had their wedding ceremony on the 6th floor in the library. It was very unique and beautiful. The planners for the wedding were very easy to work with and made their day very special. Parking is always easy. There's street parking and lot parking. It does take hours to make it through the entire museum.</18>
<19>I absolutely love the History Center. Maybe it's my love of Heinz ketchup that draws me in... But there's so much more! If you love Pittsburgh, you are seriously doing yourself a disservice if you don't visit this museum. It's basically an "I Love Pittsburgh" museum, with lost of history of course.Clearly my fave exhibit is the Heinz Ketchup one, with lots of facts on the company, as well as some great visual items (hello tall statue of ketchup made from ketchup bottles). If you love Mr. Rogers, you'll also love the permanent exhibit with lots of artifacts from the show (like the castle!). There's also a dedicated sports exhibit that any black and gold supporter loving nut will love.I don't think there's one temporary exhibit I've missed in a while. I LOVED the 1960's exhibit, had fun with the Toys show and can't wait for their new prohibition one this winter. Add in the fact that this is a great wedding or large event venue (they host a wide array of fantastic events).It's not just for the adults either. They have a cute kids area with lots of activities and older kids will be interested in the interactive exhibits and honestly probably be interested in the rich visual content they have. Seriously, if you're visiting Pittsburgh you will still love the museum, because to know Pittsburgh is to love Pittsburgh, n'at!</19>
<20>I came to Pittsburgh for two reasons: ketchup and to kick a$$.... fortunately for me they have a load of ketchup around here.Know what else they have an abundance of? Great museums.I'm sure youre thinking that people don't come to the Burgh for history, they come for IC Light and polite conversation. Wrong. Super cool exhibits right now at Heinz History. Some Walk on the Moon thing (space exploration) and the costumes from Black Panther (and a few other iconic movies). Totally worth checking out.Who knew? Kidding... I did and now you do, too.</20>
<21>I was blown away by how much this museum has to offer. I've been here a few times in the past for events but up until now, I hadn't explored the entire museum. I loved the variety of local exhibits, especially the Heinz and Mr. Rogers sections. By far my favorite section was the housing examples through the centuries. If you are a local or just visiting Pittsburgh, there is a little something for everyone here.</21>

<description>Helluva Burger + Heavenly Shakes…</description>
<reviews>
<1>Start your review of Burgatory.</1>
<2>Ordered takeout from this Burgatory location last week. I'm rarely disappointed in Burgatory...but what happened to the crab cake??? Its my favorite. This was the first time I ordered something new. I created my own burger and fries. It was delicious but I still want that crab cake. My daughter always gets the chicken tenders and devours them. My husband gets the impossible burger creating his own combo. He loves it. So easy to order online and pick up at their back door. You do not even need to get out of the car. I will be back!</2>
<3>An okay spot for a burger in Fox Chapel. It seems like an obligatory Pittsburgh thing to eat at a Burgatory, especially for visitors, but there are other places that to do burgers much better. We were able to get on the waitlist through Yelp which was nice. One of the big problems today was the service, it was pretty slow and we sat for a long time before anyone even came to our table (apparently our waiter was told we were not there). The shakes are fine, the non-alcoholic ones are overpriced. The BBQ Bacon Fries were a mess. The burgers are good but like the shakes, overpriced. You can kind of get carried away adding stuff and it really adds up. And what burger place serves chips with a burger (you can get fries for an uncharge of course).</3>
<4>I like this location, can't say I've ever bad experience here aside from maybe a long wait (I don't believe they use the waitlist). Service is excellent, the staff is generally pretty friendly. They have a great drink list including cocktails which are priced really well. They also have a happy hour though I believe it's only at the bar. The menu is pretty big and they have a great selection of starters. Most recently I had the "Standard Deluxe" burger which was very good though I kind of wish it came with fries instead of chips.</4>
<5>Pretty good food. Corn bread is dry and the butter is Ice cold. Terrible combo. The chips are very good. Burgers are nothing crazy but pretty good. I would return.</5>
<6>This was my first Burgatory experience, so I have no other locations that I can compare it to.  That said, the elk and the bacon were superb!I asked the people next to me at the bar what to get and they said the Elk Gone Wild, so I followed suit and ordered it.  I slurped down a pint while waiting on my burger, but when it came, oh it was such a beautiful thing.  Way too much food, but I certainly didn't mind having leftovers.  The elk really wasn't that "game'y", just meaty with a little extra kick.  The bacon jam was my jam!  I didn't need anything else, but I sure saw other things that I wanted to try.I'll be back, but will probably try a few other locations first before I end up back at this particular one.</6>
<7>I built my own burger with a pretzel bun, and Gouda cheese. It was an amazing burger, mixed with the Italian herb fries. Lots of variety on the menu, take your pick you won't be disappointed</7>
<8>I stopped in to get a bite to eat and cash in on my birthday milkshake (join the mailing list). I ordered: Tony's Chicken Chili it's topped with grated Farmhouse Cheddar, Chipotle Sour Cream & diced Sweet Red Onions. The chili has big chunks of chicken and a subtle spicy kick the blend of the sour cream, cheese and onion is are perfect toppings. The warm Jalapeño & Cheddar Cornbread on the side is a heavenly accompaniment to the chili. I was glad the chili left room in my stomach for the midecided to get the featured milkshake for the 4th of July holiday: The red, white and blue. I believe it was made with vanilla ice cream, chunks of white cake, blueberry & strawberry sauces topped with whipped cream and red, white & blue sprinkles. This was a really good shake and not overly sweet.</8>

<10>Wow ...Good food here!Trippin' Chicken is always a favorite, it comes on a Pretzel Bun!However, what's really impressive for what you would think as a Burger join is the awesome salads.The Green Apple and Quinoa Salad was fantastic!</10>
<11>Yes ... They know how to make Burgers and shakes here.(6) six napkin nachos are always our favorite.Kick'n Chicken on a Pretzel bun is really good.They also have pretty good salads for a burger place.However, the salad would have been better without the overwhelming amount of fried onions.Tonight we'll be using some of our "Burgatory Bucks" from the year end deal.Buy $100.00 gift card get $25.00 "Burgatory Bucks"Feels like we're getting a really good deal All in all, pretty good here ...We'll be back soon!</11>
<12>There is Great food here and also there was great service @ this establishment...  You can pick details for your 'signature' burger down to Bison meat etcetera. You can pick the type of bun, temperature, toppings, cheeses and other things. Strongly suggested.</12>
<13>Food was good and our waitress (Nikki) was nice and polite. The atmosphere was cool with lots of TVs. They offered us a seat at the bar as soon as we got there, but I needed a booth. We didn't get the beers, but the bar looked active. It was freezing cold and I wish I had a jacket. Seats were pretty comfortable and gave a good view of the restaurant. Lots of families and seems like a good date place. I would take a wife or girlfriend here. Not sure if it's cool for large groups. Unless you sit outside, there was not a lot of room for more than 5 people. My elk burger was spicy but good. There was a lot of break, so I might try the salad next time. There was a lot of meat, but not much cheese or sauce. I guess that's what you really want in a burger. Also, as I ordered it well done, it wasn't dry or bland. You'll taste the meat! Cool place to go and hang for a while.</13>
<14>Meh..... went waaaaay downhill since opening. Servers are kinda rude and don't really care.</14>
<15>this is by far the worst burgatory location in pittsburgh. we walked in after checking the waitlist that said 0-5mins, only to be told that the wait would be an hour, despite no one in front of us. we knew it wouldn't be an hour so we decided to wait anyways.the hostesses stood at the stand extremely unprofessionally, gossiping in front of us and guests that came after us. they were on their phones with their elbows on the hostess stand while we watched tables leave with no bussing being done nor any sense of urgency to seat guests.then, our waitress rushed us at every stage of our meal, cutting me off when i asked how she was doing, while we ordered, and while we ate.to make matters even worse, the waitress lost my boyfriends credit card and blamed us for it.i would suggest going to the murrysville or north shore burgatory locations instead of this one. i've gotten horrendous service every time i've been here.</15>
<16>I was craving a good burger while on my whole30 diet today.  What better choice than burgatory! I've been to the one in the North Hills many times but never to this one. We arrived for an early dinner, seated immediately, and ordered our burgers. My friend had the impossible burger- done completely brown as she insists and perfectly presented. I had the elk burger (the only grass fed meat ) loaded with whole30 compliant toppings. It was yummmmmmy!! It's smaller than the north hills one but same good food and fast service.</16>
<17>Located near the movie theatre, this is a convenient spot to grab food after a movie. I've never had a long wait (if one at all) here, and the staff is very attentive. Their signature milkshakes are delightful and well worth the price. You get a large amount (more than enough to share between two), and the mixes are sweet but well balanced. Burgatory allows you to make "custom" burgers, and have a huge amount of customizability. It's a great option when you have mixed dietary restrictions (e.g., no pork, no fiber, etc.) and want everyone to have options. Other items on their menu are more of a miss for me. Their version of poutine is extremely salty and oily, and their farmhouse salads tend to be overdressed. The slaw they offer as an extra side to your burger is overwhelmingly peppery. Overall, a great spot to come after a movie or if you're looking for a burger, but I'd come here more for the shakes.</17>
<18>I usually enjoy my meals at Burgatory. This visit didn't quite sit on par from my previous experiences. I had the elk burger and while it was a pretty thick patty, it was overdone and had pieces of cartilage throughout. Taste wise, it was bland. I ordered their menu burger instead of making my own. The sauces did nothing to enhance it. I also had the almond torte shake. I miss the days when they would leave almost half a container of leftovers for you instead of the two tablespoons I received. The shake was really heavy on the whipped cream. Otherwise, it's pretty tasty and I will probably get it again.</18>
<19>Way too much cream, and not enough ice-cream in the shakes; like literally the top half of the cup is just cream.It's weird that the burgers come with chips instead of fries.  Fries would be much better.Good burger though.  And the people working there are always friendly.  Just a little over priced.</19>
<20>We attended the evening of the 4th of July. We came for the first time during a visit to Pittsburgh.  I have a lot of dietary restrictions so I built my own "burger". The burger itself was a little small but fine but when it came to substituting my side, I picked "organic greens" which I also got on my burger and were simply pieces of lettuce. But when it came on the side for an additional $1.50 it was a side salad with cheese, tomatoes and dressing which I can't tolerate. When it arrived to asked to have just the burger and for them to take the salad back. There were no other acceptable side items and the up-charge was not removed from the bill. It was the point of it really - the menu is misleading and such a small charge not removed when I can't eat the side. For my husband he ordered a burger off the menu. It was too raw in the middle so he stopped eating it before he finished and he actually got sick in the middle of the night which delayed us heading home from our trip.I would not necessarily recommend.</20>
<21>Ok, normally I won't give a review without trying a place at least three times.  Well, I have eaten at the various Burgatories throughout Pitt. Most are ok, just ok.  This location is one of the worst.  I went there Friday, 22 March 2019 with my son and daughter-in-law.  Place was not busy, around 8pm. Some of the worst service I have had in years, red flag when the server wrote my order on the back of my son's order.   Drinks took FOREVER to arrive, a milk shake arrived first then ten minutes later a mixed drink.  Burgers took over thirty minutes to arrive then only two came, one of which had the wrong toppings.   Five minutes later, " yours will be right out sir"    They forgot to make it.   Forgot to make it because it was written on the back of another order.   Oh, thanx for the cold and greasy chips while I waited.  NOT ....    it finally arrived, luke warm, soggy bun, slimy.   They took it off the bill, luckily or the review would be worse.   Location is okay but food and especially service was not even marginal.  Wont be back to this local</21>
<22>a pleasant experience.  a friendly team.  fast service.  excellent hygienic conditions.  the food was very good, both the salad and the burger.  delicious fries.  I definitely recommend it.</22>
<23>Amazing burger! Ok I am born and raised in Pittsburgh and I am home for a visit. Decided to try this place in Waterworks and I could not have been happier with my meal. It's not often I can order an amazing burger much less in my hometown so I splurged on the piggy butter and jelly burger. OMG! Gluten free heaven! Definitely coming back! Our server was fantastic as well!</23>
<24>Do not order anything cajun here, they do not know what or how it should taste.The meat quality is great, get a regular burger and fix it up.</24>

<2>Start your review of Cathedral of Learning.</2>
<3>This place was one of my favorite places to visit in Pittsburgh! I definitely recommend to visit this place. It is very beautiful and definitely reminds you of Hogwarts! We loved strolling through the main floor and walking up a set of spiral stairs hidden away from the elevators. We really enjoyed seeing the Nationality Rooms. Each room is built with only materials from that country, even the stones/building materials inside. We had a nice pleasure of speaking with someone from the University talk to us about the Irish room and told us that each room takes a lot of effort and costs about $1M. The elevators are way ahead of ones I've seen! You press the floor you want to go to, and the screen tells you which elevator to get on. We overheard about the 36th floor so we went up there. It's a small floor but you can look out the window and see great views! We didn't have a lot of time so we couldn't stay long, but I can definitely explore this area and the rest of the University the entire day!</3>
<4>Turns out, Hogwarts is in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania! The Cathedral of Learning is a beautiful space perfect for some quiet studying. Come here to work on your problem sets under soaring stone archways. If you're a tourist, it's worth a quick peek inside of you're in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way just to visit.</4>
<5>Fantastic, iconic architecture, the Cathedral of Learning is a true Pittsburgh icon. We have always enjoyed the cultural events hosted in the Cathedral. The Nationality Rooms are worth visiting, and it's nice they are free and open to the public for viewing. The building is a little difficult to access if you're in a wheelchair or if you have a baby stroller.</5>
<6>I've traveled a decent amount and this is still one of the most gorgeous buildings I've ever been to. A beautiful gothic gem, standing high over Oakland, it catches your eye no matter how many times you've seen it. Touring the building alone would be amazing. Add in the Nationality Rooms and you have a unique, unforgettable day ahead of you. The rooms are all designed to look as authentic as possible. They have real items from those countries with nice paragraphs explaining them. They host a holiday open house each year and it's an event I would hate to miss. It's PACKED but you still have room to explore everything there is to offer. Each room is decorated in that country's winter holiday with a volunteer in traditional dress that explains how each country celebrates. The great hall has performances and food that is to die for. This is key for anyone visiting Pittsburgh.</6>
<7>This is a beautiful place across the quad from the Heinz Chapel on the grounds of The University of Pittsburgh. When you go in to the very large area where everyone is sitting it reminds me of Oxford of Cambridge University in England. Or if your so inclined Harry Potter. There are many floors with different rooms. My father took his German classes in the German Room. Unfortunately they were doing some work in the place but it's really something to see. Parking is interesting.. that's all I got.</7>
<8>The Cathedral of Learning has been on my "to see" list for years, and it's never been quite the right timing for us to visit, until this last venture to Pittsburgh.I was so excited to be able to see the nationalities rooms that I've heard about for so long.  The building itself is impressive from the outside, and then when we headed inside, I was surprised to find such a gothic-looking cathedral design.  I mean I know it's a cathedral, but the outside doesn't give you the sense of what you're going to experience inside.  I imagine this is a great place to gather with friends and fellow students.  I could see myself studying here, or coming here just to get some work done.The nationality rooms were great.  We opted to do the self-guided tour and got the audio and key to the first floor rooms.  Some of the rooms are impressive!  We started out on the first floor, and then headed upstairs to the third floor rooms which are unlocked and propped open.  I really enjoyed the 1st floor rooms the most, especially the Czechoslovak room... and upstairs the Ukrainian room.  This is a one-of-a-kind attraction which values education.  It's a EXCEPTIONAL thing to see!  I'm  so glad we finally went. We visited on a Sunday around 11:30.  I think this is the perfect time to visit.  School was in session for the semester, but obviously there are no classes on Sundays, so this is the best time to visit.  You won't be interrupting classes (yes, the rooms are used for classes - how cool would that be).  The pace is set by you, and you can take as long or as little time as you want.  Maybe not the best for small children as I don't think they will appreciate it, but older students and fans of travel and learning about various cultures will love it!</8>
<9>This is a must see... history, architecture, multicultural studies. It's a beautiful, huge building that is a true hidden gem. The multicultural classrooms are especially decked out during the holidays, with audio tapes to share their history. Allow plenty of time to explore, sit and soak in the culture, and to look in the books and crannies of each room.</9>
<10>Gorgeous, incredible wonder that Pittsburgh must be proud of!  Amazing architecture and beauty, historic artifacts from around the world in the 3rd floor international classrooms.</10>
<11>The Cahtedral of Lerning is a plaice where peeple, espeically studints, go too practise there spelling bes and prepere four all off lifes litle chalinges.This towering, haunting, magnificent cathedral is one of the world's most amazing sights, set amongst the already picturesque, beautiful, mountainside city of Pittsburgh. U Pitt is one of the most beautiful campuses in the country. It's got a splendid hospital, many grand old buildings, some sparkling new ones, some awesomely-designed rotunda-style residence halls, and best of all, it has the dominant, towering, sensational Cathedral of Learning. One of the most beautiful buildings in all the country, and it's not even religious. It's now a college building, and I've been in there on many occasions, and it's amazing. Inside, it feels old and European. You can forget you are in Pittsburgh for awhile.Pittsburgh girls are amazing. I dated a girl from this campus and visited her a lot. She is now a fashion designer. Hi, if you're reading. Miss you. I first met her inside the Cathedral Of Learning. So this whole campus has wonderful memories for me and I go back often. But specifically this cathedral reminds me of her every time I am here.</11>
<12>Favorite school building ever - partial because I'm a Pitt alum #H2P My favorite nationality room is the Austrian room - the ballroom style is absolutely beautiful. The great hall is amazing and during Christmas time, it made me feel like I went to hogwarts which is basically a dream come true.</12>
<13>My friend came into town and I wanted to show him a couple places in Pittsburgh. On the way to Mount Washington, we stopped by Cathy. It is a beautiful building with wonderful Gothic architecture. Every time I walk in, I am full of awe. My friend was very astonished too. We started off trying to see how far up we could go up, and yes you can go very very far up. We were able to see some nice views but they weren't great as the windows were in some weird positions. After this, we traveled back down to the 3rd floor to see the nationality rooms. They're all so beautiful and unique in the style they were built. My personal favorite was the Austrian room. We went back on the first floor where we were not able to see the rooms as they were locked and you must pay $4 to see them. We decided not to do this as we were pleased with what we say on the 3rd floor and it was free. This is definitely a place to take friends and visitors who are new to Pittsburgh and the campus.</13>
<14>The outside of the building is beautiful. The inside is interesting. The basement consists of a small Starbucks and a cafeteria. The first floor is a large open area with tables for studying. The first few floors have some classrooms based off of historic time periods. They look cool but are incredibly uncomfortable and usually lack tech features for PowerPoint or media. Most of the classrooms are pretty average but some of the upper level floors are being remodeled and are absolutely beautiful. You also get a great view of Oakland from the upper level windows.</14>
<15>If you like history and architecture, this building visit is a must.If you think that you have to see a city from above in order to get a right scale of it,  this building visit is a must.If you like to feel like you are in Hogwarts castle, this building visit is a must.If you want to get a feel how ethnic groups made up America (the Hands That Built America) the visit to this building and its nationality rooms is a must. The link with more info is here: nationalityrooms.pitt.eduIf you want to imagine how it would look if your college classroom would have a chandelier (for example) the visit to this building is a must.If you just want to see something unique, this building visit is a must.</15>
<16>A must see if you are in Pittsburgh. Beautiful building. Visiting the nationality rooms is one of the most intresting and unique  experiences you can have.

<17>The Cathedral of Learning was an amazing experience! I want to be a Univ of Pitt student just to experience taking a class in one of these rooms. The feeling of history is awe-inspiring.</17>
<18>If you're traveling to Pittsburgh, make this a stop on your trip!! The building is beautiful, it feels like you have stepped into Hogwarts. The architecture is incredible, it is absolutely lovely.They also have these nationality rooms, which are these amazingly designed classrooms to mimic classrooms around the world. They are beautiful and intriguing.  Some we were able to access for free while others you have to go on the tour to view because they kept them locked.  I think the tour was only $5 but we did not do it, however if you're visiting I would suggest it, the classrooms are amazing.</18>
<19>The Cathedral of Learning is the heart and soul of campus pride at the University of Pittsburgh. Affectionately dubbed "Cathy" by Pitt students, the Cathedral is anthropomorphized as a maternal figure to students. Towering 535 feet into the air, and holding 42 floors of classrooms, offices, lecture halls, dining areas, theaters, and more, the Cathedral is a hub for campus activity.The Cathedral is the largest educational building in the Western Hemisphere, and amazes tourists, visitors and locals alike. The building's construction during the Depression was partially funded by contributions made from foreign governments. As a result, many of the classrooms in the 1st through 3rd floors have been dubbed "Nationality Rooms," which feature architectural and artistic constructions influenced by the cultures of their respective countries.I can't fully explain how much this building has to offer, but if you're a Pitt student, you know how important Cathy is. If you're in Pittsburgh, a tour of the Cathedral is an absolute must. You will be blown away by the scale and grandeur of this structure.</19>
<20>Every time I'm here I see something new! I love coming to wander around here or just sitting inside the beautiful common rooms. I came around the holidays this time, and it looked really nice decorated in each country's version of holiday festivity.</20>
<21>I came to visit this place with a friend when we stopped off in Pittsburgh.  This is definitely the most gangsta building on any college campus I've been to so far.  6 stars for sure!The architecture on both the exterior and interior of the building is unbelievable.  We came on like a Tuesday and admission was free.  The aura of the place hits you as soon as you walk in; it's like dammmnnnn.  We hit up the nationality rooms, which were all very interesting.  They have so many of them actually, so you could easily spend a good portion of the day here.  You have to pay for the ones on the first floor for some odd reason, so we skipped those.  We also took the elevator to the top floor, and there were some nice views from up there.  Great place to visit and I enjoyed it thoroughly.  The entire surrounding area of the Pitt campus was pretty nice actually.</21>
<22>My friends and I come here when we want to mix up our winter season work out. We'll climb the stairs at a walking pace, reach the top floor, take the elevator down, then climb up again!  Lots of others also tend to do this, so it's good to be mindful of the students and faculty also using the stairs. There's not really any place to put your stuff as you climb, so make sure you either pack light, or prepare to carry it all for an extra challenge!There's a really cool tradition they have in the library on the first floor of bringing in dogs for the students to pet on Tuesdays. There's water fountains near the cafes.</22>

<1>i couldn't understand why when i checked out Tocayos reviews, 9/10 photos were tacos. I mean, is that all this restaurant serves? But... then... I TASTED THEM.  I've never had a more flavorful taco in my life. The ingredients were fresh and perfectly paired together to make tacos unlike any I've tasted before.  The chicken taco had a little piece of delicious kale on it. Only Tocayo could make kale taste so perfect on a taco. They were large tacos with toppings falling off (they don't skimp on you). My margarita was a punch of sweet and spicy. Many restaurants, you take 2 sips and your marg is gone. But not at Tocayo! It was a fair size for the prize.  I even got free chips with my choice of 2 sides just for checking in on Yelp!  Who doesn't want a free app?  The staff was prompt and friendly, going out of their way to make sure I enjoyed my first visit. They followed Covid guidelines appropriately. The atmosphere was cozy and authentic. The menu included many types of tacos you could mix and match!  It even came with a side salad or soup.   The menu also had burritos and other items but let's be real just order the tacos because they are incredible.  I brought my second taco home and ate it within an hour because i just couldn't wait to try it!!I can't wait to return to Tocayo. What an excellent find.</1>
<2>All around excellent taco joint!Food: Tasty, well-balanced flavors and generous portions. My husband has a hearty appetite and wasn't convinced that two tacos would be enough. But with the house salad that came with it (which had the perfect amount of dressing), it was just right. The tacos were flavorful, but not overly spicy. I went with a chicken quesadilla and it was super filling. Price: While the prices seem a bit high, the food quality totally justifies it.COVID Service: Our delivery came...earlier than estimated! Mind blown. And if you're within a 3 mile radius, delivery is free on orders over $30. I'll also give them bonus points for managing nice presentation on a delivery order!</2>
<3>Ordered both lunch specials for pick up. Spent ~$25 and ~15 min. Love the soup, taste like pumpkin with coconut.</3>
<4>I'm so glad I found Tocayo. When I lived near Baltimore before coming back to Pittsburgh, I had a go-to burrito place that I hit about once a week. When I first tried Tocayo, I tried the steak burrito. Very good. I ordered a side of guacamole which was HUGE. Physically large. With the side salad and chips included with burritos, it was too much for just me.A few days ago, I got the veggie burrito. THIS is my new go-to Pittsburgh burrito. The veggie mix was primo. For $14, chips, a burrito, chips and salsa... You can't beat what you get for the amazing quality.Tocayo is a great pick for Mexican food in the pandemic.</4>
<5>Great new taco place in shadyside! I got the carnitas and chorizo tacos and both were delicious. They were also huge- 2 was almost too much. The chips and salsa and queso were also great. Happy hour Marg was $7! Will definently come back to try out some other things.</5>
<6>I recently meet up with a friend here. We got there around 6:30 on a Wednesday. There was plenty of open tables, and we were seated immediately by a friendly hostess.  There is long bar is upfront, plenty of cozy booths and tables throughout the space. The décor is a modern cucina vibe with beautiful colors and modern lighting, creating a fun ambiance. We both started with the pozole verde soup which was so flavorful and delicious with plenty of pulled chicken. I ordered mix and match tacos and got one chicken chorizo and another barbacoa. They were each well balanced with flavor and texture, juicy with bits of crunch. Plus  seasoned amazingly well!Our tacos were packed to the brim and really filling! Well for about $17 for two, with no sides, they better be!  This is very steep compared to other taco restaurants in the area, but the quality of taco was superb. The service was very quick! It felt like our food was served within minuets of ordering. The margarita menu looked fun, but looked pricey, so I didn't try on this trip. I would recommend this spot. Its beautiful with lots of choose from on the menu. The two tacos I tried and the soup were delicious.  Just keep in mind the restaurant is located on a side street in Shadyside, so it's difficult to find parking.</6>
<7>The location has been so many different things over the years, I am happy to see the Tocayo gang spreading out from Mt. Lebanon with this newest spot.I hadn't been able to make it here prior to the Yelp Elite event a couple of weeks ago. However, I have been back three times since then. I am so in love with almost everything on the menu! Just like the other location, the food is impeccable, full of flavor and all around delicious.The service hasn't changed wither. Everyone is so nice and happy which makes for a more enjoyable meal.I am really glad to be within walking distance since I can't get out to the South Hills as much.Looks like I have a new fave place!</7>
<8>I went back there couple times. Either get the bowl or Tacos. The tacos are a little too bland for me personally and the portions are small for the price. I really like their sweet corn soup and freshly made guacamole.Service 5/5 as usual. Very attentive and fast service</8>
<9>We went there for lunch on Sunday. They are working on Brunch menu but their current lunch menu is also a good deal.Decorations - 5/5 despite the small space, I like their whole decoration and lighting. Service - 5/5 servers and host are very attentive, friendly and fast. Food - 5/5 totally worth it. Taste pretty authentic. I love the chorizo, it was not too salty or dry. The portion size is huge. Their Mexican mojito was very good. It was not overly sweet or too water down.I will go back here to try other stuffs on the menu and bring my friends there</9>
<10>This place charges SEVENTEEN dollars for two tacos. How are they still in business? Have people just not had tacos before? Genuinely baffled.Food is alright. Unfortunately not worth the $$$, which is a shame because Shadyside could use a reliable taco joint.</10>
<11>We'd been meaning to check Tocayo, and the Yelp Elite event was a perfect opportunity. I was provided with a free entree as part of this event. We started with chips and salsa--the queso and tomatillo salsas were delicious. The tomatillo salsa was bright with cilantro and citrus flavors. The queso was warm and velvety without being too rich. The chips were extra crispy, and I am here for that kind of savory surprise. Next came our salad and soup. I ordered the corn soup, which took me by surprise. The sweet and savory are well balanced in this rich soup. I want to compare it to creamed corn or a corn chowder, but those concepts don't quite do it justice. It's much smoother with a bit of textural contrast from the corn. It's hard to describe, but I recommend it if you're a fan of anything corn and roasted squash bisque. My dining companion went with salad, and was quite happy with it. I was able to taste the cilantro dressing, which was light and flavorful. For my entree, I had the steak and barbacoa tacos. They were both quite tasty, and they featured the elevation and fresh ingredients that you want to see from a taqueria that's serving a contemporary take on tacos. The barbacoa taco was delicious, and the salsa roja really stole the show for me. The steak taco, however, blew it out of the water. The ribeye steak was tender but also had crispy edges that led to a textural contrast that I didn't even know I needed. The ambience is well-curated so that Tocayo would be a great setting for a date night or a meal out with friends. The LED candles and plants lend to a cozy atmosphere while the choices of contemporary color accents keep the place feeling modern. It was quiet during our lunch time visit. We'll definitely be back, and I'll have to update my review when we try some of their drinks.</11>
<12>The first that I have heard of this restaurant was as an advertisement for the Yelp Elite event. While this was a perfect opportunity I wish I had discovered them sooner. Three of my co-workers and I arrived at Tocayo on Thursday evening around 6 pm. They were packed, but it wasn't too long of a wait for a table. Let me first say this I LOVE the ambiance of the restaurant (5/5). With the Yelp Event, I was able to receive one free entree. Luckily, with just a few modifications several of the dishes that they offer are able to be made vegan. In addition to the vegan items, they are gluten-free friendly. The food was simply AMAZING. It was seasoned to perfection and the ingredients complimented each other well. It's a great opportunity to get gourmet tacos at an affordable price. The margaritas were DELICIOUS. My co-worker and I both ordered a strawberry mango margarita. They were blended to perfection. The service was fantastic as well. Our servers were committed to assuring we left satisfied with our tummies full. The general manager came to the table and we had a great conversation. This small touchpoint was so meaningful and showed the genuine care they possess in their service.   It's a great area to hang around after dinner.</12>
<13>So overrated for the price. Ordered takeout, my friend and I got the pick 2 option and they mixed our options together. Thankfully neither one of us have dietary restrictions/are vegetarians otherwise that would've been a disaster! And the food is sooo basic, nothing really special. I got the empanada & quesadilla combo. I could've gotten more authentic, better tasting Mexican food for less. But, their Espresso Lava Cake is delicious, so there's that if you're a dessert person.</13>
<14>Such a fun night with friends! It wasn't particularly busy on a Wednesday evening around 6 and so we were immediately seated at one of the high tables. The wait staff were attentive and quick to refill our glasses and knowledgeable in their recommendations. I really loved my shrimp and steak tacos as the ingredients were fresh and the meat was tender. We also got chips and queso which is always a big hit for me. The chips are a little thicker which was handy with the scooping. As for ambiance, this place felt warm, cozy and clean. Candles along the wall, warm colors and sparkling clean. Fun area, great food!</14>
<15>Another decent taco place in Pittsburgh!* Food: Before sitting down to order, I already fell in love with the vibe here. There was a decent amount of seating in the back but it still felt cozy. I got 1 Barbacoa and 1 Carnitas. The tacos came with a side of salad or soup (I got the salad while my friend got the corn soup and I regretted my choice a little bit). Both were tasty so it depends what mood you're in. Some of their options come with a flour tortilla while others come in a corn tortilla. I'm not sure if you get to pick but I definitely appreciate corn more. For drinks, my friend got the Spicy Watermelon Margarita and I got the Mango Mexican Mojito. I would recommend both to anyone that likes more sweet drinks.   * Cost vs. Worth: Tacos (comes in 2) averaged around $15. In terms of comparing it to other places, I already have my favorite taco joints that are cheaper and equally as delicious. With the vibe and food quality, I would still recommend this place to others.  Will I come here again? - If I'm in the area and craving tacos, yes. If not, I want to try other taco places! Nothing against this place though. They have happy hour (M-F 4pm-6pm) with 1/2 off appetizers which I might try in the future.</15>
<16>Went to Tocayo on Friday for lunch around 11:30am. I think we were the first guests in the restaurant that day. If you check into yelp, you get free chips with the pick of 2 dips. We chose the queso and the mild salsa. I kid you not when I say this was the BEST queso I've ever eaten in my life. The chips were also very good. Not salty or greasy. For my entree I chose the brunch bowl. Ahhh sooo good. Loved the addition of the eggs on top of the bowl. I also added some of the queso from our appetizer. A ++++. Our waiter was really friendly and attentive. I will definitely be back to check out the happy hour specials and to get more queso.</16>
<17>As a Texas native, who also spends a lot of time in Mexico, I'm a Mexican food snob. I have yet to discover authentic Mexican food, here in Pittsburgh.....Now I have!I was extremely satisfied with my meal. My rice bowl was incredible, and my friends' meals were delicious as well. Everybody was raving about the food, and it was so refreshing to have a modern take on authentic Mexican food. The drinks weren't your classic marg mix either. They had fresh ingredients, and were perfect!The customer service was great, however, the reason for four stars and not five, is the size of the venue. The space has a very cool vibe, however, there aren't many tables. During our meal, the place got packed, and everybody waiting, was standing around our table in groups. It felt a little uncomfortable and very crowded. If you plan on going, it's well worth it, but definitely make a reservation!</17>
<18>Pretttttttyyyy good!  Came in for a late Sunday lunch thanks to the Yelp reviews that called out the gluten free friendliness!  We had chips and salsa, with the choice to select from 2 salsas, which also included queso, which was a unique offering to be grouped with "salsas."  So we took advantage of the option and paired with a mild salsa.  I liked that they offered corn tortilla chips that were crunchy and thicker.  They looked sturdy enough for a heaping plate of nachos, not like the delicate kind that breaks mid-scoop or gets soggy under a pile of cheese.  Unfortunately because we had dip, we did not get nachos, but that will definitely be the plan next time!  Nevertheless, the chips alone were very good!  Salsa wasn't super remarkable, and queso was getting to be too salty after a few bites.  I also thought the tacos tocayo was great - choice of 2 tacos (same or mix and match) and a side (salad or soup).  My tacos (chicken and al pastor) were heaping!  So much filling (not all meat, but more toppings) that there was no doubt "only" 2 tacos would fill me up.  I really enjoyed both tacos in terms of the tortilla (blue corn) and flavor combinations of the meat and toppings.  For my side, I had the the salad, which I enjoyed for the most part.  Unfortunately something got mixed up with the orders and they forgot to bring it before the tacos, even though my dining partner received their soup at the appropriate time.  I had to ask for the salad, but by the time it came I was done with the tacos.  Post-taco salad is not as appetizing.  Overall, solid Mexican food (more upscale than hole in the wall type), with  plenty of gluten free options.  Would visit again.</18>
<19>$111 for absolutely tasteless food! Ground beef taco and burrito. Steak and shrimp tacos. Nada!!</19>
<20>Good solid Mexican food, but nothing off the scale, here. Now my Mexican food standards are high, I will admit, so they only secure a three. And Tocayo would get a four if it wasn't for the high prices. High prices means you are held to a higher standard, and, well, you didn't register even a four. If your tacos are $7, I should not be able to get a $2 taco that's much, much better. But I can. Tocayo is charging a lot for what it is offering here. Mex food is really inexpensive to make. Just a-ok, here.Great flan, Churros were a bit old, and not fresh. Pastor taco? Just ok. Very good verde enchiladas, solid salads.......Chorizo? They need to get back to the drawing board. Not spicy at all, little flavor. Queso fundido was good, but yellow running cheese could be replaced by some real Mexican cheese. The real test? Would I go back? Probably not. I'll look for another Mexican spot in Pittsburgh that's not so pricey, and not trying so hard to be high end. In the defense of the eatery, I didn't try multiple tacos.........which were selling for as much as $17 for two!</20>
<21>Tocayo is a welcome addition to the shadyside neighborhood! I'm glad I finally made it there to check out what the hype as been about! Honestly, this was by far the best Mexican food in comparison to the other comparable joints in the area. We started with happy hour deals. I got a corona light draft which was $1 off and my friend got the happy hour Marg! All apps are also 1/2 off, so we enjoyed an order of table side guac! So good - the chips were homemade and warm and the guac was beyond fresh and delicious. They even asked if we wanted all the ingredients (duh) and our spice level preference. I ordered the tocayo salad with steak and it was amazing. I love a good taco salad but this was next level with the flavors and fresh vegetables that added to the salad. My friend ordered tacos she really enjoyed, too!I can't wait to go back and try more things on the menu, but one thing is for sure, I will never pass up that guac!</21>

<1>This is really as good as it gets! The service was out of this world. My husband and I stopped in Pittsburgh on our way back to Chicago and decided to have dinner here. The staff was beyond friendly, gave us tips on MUST see romantic things in Pittsburgh, and took us away on the most exciting cultural journey. Top it all off, they are BYOB and also served my husband and I a complimentary glass of wine and dessert each for our Minimoon celebration.</1>
<2>I thought the food was decent.... the rice was sticky, so not true dill rice pilaf.  It was disappointing!  The lamb kabobs were very good.  I'm not sure the side salad did anything for the entree.  Also the restaurant didn't have mint tea so went with the Turkish Tea, which was very good!! Skip the cream caramel.... extremely heavy and filling, unlike flan ! Good spot for dinnOwner corrected me.... definitely I had the restaurant confused for a Lebanese restaurant, which tend to be delicious!! Sorry!! Next time I'll frequent the Greek restaurants next door or the Indian restaurants across the street.</2>

<4>Incredible customer service. Great food. The turkish bread with oil was delicious. The server tried to get us fresh bread but the bakery was busy. She said she has bread but its 1 day old and she doesn't like to serve old bread. You cant beat that quality control. Reasonably priced. Also I ate at the "authentic greek" place right next door the day before and would advise you to avoid it like a demon. I have a review on it too. This place is 100x better.</4>
<5>I just love this place it is my favorite place in Pittsburgh! We were going to the Byham Theater so I made reservations and very glad I did they were very busy with a very large party but that did not effect the service they gave to us. Always very friendly staff and always on the ball with filling your water glasses when needed. This is a Turkish/ Mediterranean Cuisine Restaurant.We started with 2 cold appetizers Hummus and Tabbouleh, they also bring each table a basket of warm Turkish bread with dipping oil for bread. There Hummus is the BEST!For dinner we had Lamb Shish Kebab ( Skewered lean cubes ) and Lamb Adana Kebab ( Finely ground lamb ) Both are delicious with so much flavor both served with rice and small salad.There is a parking garage right next door to Restaurant This is a BYOB Restaurant</5>
<6>We had a Delicious dinner last weekend celebrating my birthday. I had made reservations and so glad I did they place was full. We started with a cold appetizer plate with a mix of all the cold appetizers, it was all very good, the hummus was my favorite. For dinner we shared the Mixed Kebabs plate the favors are out of this world just delicious !! We had no room for dessert but we will most definitely be back an try the dessert next time! Very friendly staff</6>
<7>Absolutely amazing.. fresh delicious authentic Mediterranean cuisine. Street side dinning ... friendly fast staff. Menu is perfect for small bites to full on mealsThe menu is traditional and has options for everyone.</7>
<8>Thank you for coming!Nice pictures ;)</8>
<9>We had a lovely dinner here on a Monday evening (best time to dine out to avoid crowds). Our server was very attentive and treated us to an extra, free and delicious chick pea salad appetizer. Their homemade bread is excellent! Main dishes grilled sea bass and homemade felafel were very tasty with generous portions. This is the most authentic Turkish food I've had in Pittsburgh. The restaurant (including restrooms) is very clean and spacious.</9>
<10>My mom and I ate here for dinner last night and it truly hit the spot. I had falafel, grape leaves, and topped the night off with baklava. I love Mediterranean food and this restaurant definitely did the food justice. The atmosphere was also nice for the lights were dim but not too dim, the art and waterfall were beautiful, and the service was great! Oh and I got to try a Turkish tea which I clearly enjoyed (I had two cups)! Eating here was a great way to complete our stop in Pittsburgh!</10>
<11>I didn't mind waiting longer then expected for the delivery but the food was a disappointment. The"gyro in a wrap" was basically an empty wrap with a few pieces of paper dry meat and some unrecognizable vegetables. The Tiramisu was FROZEN as I got it. I miss Europe....</11>
<12>Wonderful place for authentic Turkish cuisine!!! I had the hummus with bread and it was so fresh. The Doner Kebab with rice is simply amazing! The flavor was fantastic and they are not skimpy with their portions! Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!!!!</12>
<13>Thank you! Please come again soon</13>
<14>Our go-to lunch place. Amazing lunch specials! They have something for everyone. Fish, lamb and chicken dishes are all good! Tiramisu and baklava desserts are great. They have veggie options as well.All servers are all attentive and can tell you more about the exotic cuisine.Place looks big enough for groups as large as 50.</14>
<15>Thanks a lot for your review. Please come again soon.</15>
<16>Food was great this is my fourth time Visiting the restaurant and their service is consistently fast and my experience are very pleasant.. My favorites are Sea Bass Salmon Calamari and Chicket Shish and Adana. I really love their desserts Baklava Kunefe and Tiramisu.. Definitely worth it as one of my go to restaurants in pittsburgh downtown.</16>
<17>Thank you! Always a pleasure to have you here!</17>
<18>I had a great experience at this place with many of their grill dishes, I love the location and the authentic salad and dessert.</18>
<19>The service was rushed (while there were about four full tables). I had to ask for napkins and cutlery. I was surprised when she said ".. here is the Turkish bread ..", it was just flattened sliced baguette! I've been in Turkey enough to know the bread, at least. So you can guess the rest. I exclude one star for service, and one star for the amount of food corresponding to the price.So you may ask what are the three stars for? One star for the cleanness and nice atmosphere; one star for the food (even though it wasn't what I expected, it felt fresh with nice taste); and one star for the minced olives and walnuts.</19>
<20>A baguette? That never passed our door. We serve our homemade Turkish bread made according to our mom’s recipe - and she lives in a small village in mountains in Rize, Black Sea region. If you visited Turkey, then you probably know that every region, every city and even every village has different ways of cooking similar meals. Our cuisine is the richest one in the world! We wonder if you ever made it to bakeries in Turkey - you would see tables and shelfs filled with dozens of different kinds of bread, in every city different ones. Sorry we didn’t meet your expectations.And the fact that both people from you table are writing a bad comment on yelp, looks like a purpose to put our rating done.</20>
<21>This is an amazing restaurant. The owner was able to accommodate my family with no reservation since we where there for one day. This is a place I will alway remember since I gave the ring to my wife here. The food was amazing and the lady serving us so sweet and gentle. Fresh food, well cooked and you can bring your wine from outside. What can you ask more?Will be here again!</21>
<22>Hopefully soon! Your family will be long remembered here! I cant believe that we almost missed the proposal :) i am glad you waited for the table couple of minutes since we were full :).</22>
<23>A lovely place but - Vegetarians - the food is fine but QUITE expensive for small portions.  Falafel is not expensive to make and while this style of falafel is rather different from other types - regardless - 4 small falafel for $7 and 4 'big' falafel for $17?!?! It is just Falafel! Chickpeas, some herbs and veggies; it doesn't come with hummus just a little tin of tahini/yogurt sauce - again, not expensive. To put together a veggie meal, we ordered appetizers - hummus, grilled veggies, and falafel. We were served some odd bread and a dish of minced olives and walnuts - that was tasty. We had to ask for some pita. It was not much food and based on the small portions, we decided not to order anything more and left to try to find some dinner. Alihan - a vegetarian plate would be the solution here. There are SO many of vegans and vegetarians and falafel and other Mediterranean sides can easily make a good meal for us. We shouldn't have to order a lot of expensive sides if we are the only Vegetarians at the table and we all know these ingredients are not expensive. So - $17 for 4 falafel and 3-4  other smaller sized veggie sides on the same platter? Yes. $17 for some cheap iceberg lettuce, a small tin of tahini & yogurt, and 4 flat 3-4 inch wide falafel? Or $7 for 4 x1 inch falafel?  Nope.Later - same day:The owner answered - and doesn't know I have been there before -have been there for work a few times. I know the $17 falafel plate. My review is fair and there should be less expensive vegetarian plates that are not a single dish. Too bad the owner cannot take some constructive feedback. That is what it is meant to be - a vegetarian plate - not a single dish - would be an asset to his menu. Public opinion matters - wouldn't you rather have us tell you?</23>
<24>We actually serve pretty large portions of our vegetarian and vegan meals: vegetarian saute, white bean salad, falafel, eggplant parm - many of our guests dont even finish their plates because the portions are large. You didnt even see the portion of falafel that is for $17 - it is 10 oz of falafel and most people take one piece home, because three are enough for dinner. It also comes with a salad with cucumbers, tomatoes, olives... the iceberg which you had on plate for your mini falafel appetizer was just a garnish. So sorry, but you have ordered wrong meals and that is why you were disappointed. You didnt even see the plate for $17, why are you complaining about it? That’s unfair. And the fact that both people from you table are writing a bad comment on yelp, looks like a purpose to put our rating done.</24>
<25>Finally made it for a preshow dinner and had a great time! The service was very attentive and friendly from the get go and left a great impression. We ended up getting a large kebab platter (small portion of each type of meat) and hummus with pita. The hummus was delicious and filling and the meats on the platter were very tasty. All of the kebabs were well seasoned and went well with the hummus, rice, and salad that accompanied. The platter was a very generous serving as well, easily shared by two people for dinner, with some leftover to go! We finished off the meal with a Turkish coffee and tea. Both drinks were very strong and gave a great boost! Helped us stay awake for the show after our feast :) We didn't get a chance to try the dessert, but would love to the next time we make it over.</25>
<26>Thank you!We are hoping to see you soon again!</26>
<27>We took my boyfriend's mom here for her 50th birthday. She loves Mediterranean food and we wanted a BYOB place. It didn't disappoint!Atmosphere is what you'd expect. Smaller, so it makes everything seem more personal. They have lots of staff running around, so it seems hectic, but everyone is very friendly. I ordered the chicken kabobs. So good! Chicken was cooked perfectly and not dry at all. It came with a salad and, veggies and rice. It was $20 and a decent amount of food. I didn't leave feeling stuffed, but definitely full. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their meals.</27>
<28>Thank you for coming! Please come soon again.</28>
<29>Great place! Nice and inexpensive appetizers, so that you can try a couple. Kebab and chicken saute  were very good. And the staff is super polite and engaging!</29>
<30>Why does everything close so early in downtown Pittsburg? Ok, on monday evening, that is. So I was happy to find Alihan's open and still serving after 9pm.I started with an excellent hummus plate, which came with good bread. The lamb shish kebab was great with very flavorful meat. I would like to subtract half a star for the salad which is rather blah.But Alihan gets the half point royally back for Turkish coffee that was both very good and spectacularly served in elaborate metal work.</30>
<31>Thank you for your review :) Come to see us soon again and this time order any of our specialty salads to replace the house salad. You will love it!</31>
<32>This spot is real Turkish restaurant. I suggest everyone to start to their meal by Lentil Soup!</32>

<reviews>
<1>Start your review of Primanti Bros. Restaurant and Bar Market Square.</1>
<2>So I'm from the West Coast and I been dying to eat at Primanti's since I've seen it on TV like 15 years ago. Welp, my wife and I are on a crazy road trip and landed in Pittsburgh in the middle of COVID-19 on July 5th.It. Did. NOT. Disappoint! To anyone who wrote a bad review, you didn't order correctly and I just feel sorry you now. I got the Joe, Dick, and Stanley (My way which was with added bacon and double cheese, I totally recommend it this way. Wish I ordered it with extra slaw too!)This sandwich was perfect. My only regret is not also ordering extra slaw on my sandwich because the truth is, it's the slaw that makes the sandwich not the fries, but the fries are definitely crucial. The slaw is cold and vinegar-y. The bread is soft yet sturdy. The meat had real flavor and you could taste the quality. The added bacon lended for some textural crunch. And the sandwich was hot which made my cheese all melty. I took my time eating this sandwich. Going slow. Savoring every bite. Can't wait for a second trip back to this amazing city for another taste of that amazing sandwich.</2>
<3>Open during COVID.  An interesting take on the traditional sandwich platter.  In particular, all the food is served between two pieces of good white bread.  In my case, the pastrami was sandwiched along with french fries, coleslaw and cheese.  It sounds and looks funny, but it works.  Kudos for ingenuity.</3>
<4>Lots of outdoor dining available during COVID-times right in Market Square! My wife and I have been here several times over the past few weeks. I've tried different sandwiches each time we've gone and they were each fantastic. You cannot go wrong! Who would've thought that French fries in a sandwich would be so good? The portions are large and the prices are great. Also, this is overall just a great Pittsburgh classic. Enjoy!</4>
<5>What an amazing experience. The sandwiches are large and in charge. It's not your typical hamburger bun, but white fluffy dry bread. The coleslaw is sweet and light. Very different then your typical soggy coleslaw. Next is a generous amount of French fries, then the meat of your choice, then another massive piece of bread. This sandwich is cut in half and most can only finish one half. The BLT totes are a great starter too. We each tried a different sandwich. The steak/serloin, Cajun chickek (my choice and the best, not spicy), fish, sausage were all we had. Each one was yummy.</5>
<6>I had my first Pittsburger today. You don't get much more overrated than this. The much vaunted "almost-famous" sandwich is basically a well done gas station burger with a pound of slaw and a small amount of tasteless fries on top. Is this a joke? This is Pitt's culinary gem? Can you imagine if Chicago pizza was this bad? If New Orleans gumbo was just Dinty-Moore? I'm speechless. You can get a better sandwich at an airport Subway.</6>
<7>I was staying in Pittsburgh for work and everyone kept telling me to give Primanti Bros. a try. Made a trip down here and ordered myself a double roast with bacon and cheddar. I also ordered the sirloin steak and cheese. The sandwiches are thicc and overpacked! The roast beef was my favorite, it had a burnt edge on it which made it tasted amazing. I didn't really care for the sirloin steak and cheese. Too me, it tasted like a burger patty. I would definitely come back and try out the rest of the menu.</7>
<8>It was our first time in Pittsburg and so of course, we had to try Primanti Brothers. We ordered a Pittsburger and a Pastrami - both with onions. We were so excited for our burgers, if only it wasn't a 45 minute wait. This location was busy fulfilling Doordash orders, tending to customers as well as take out orders. To be fair, the sandwich was tasty and we thoroughly enjoyed it, but then again, we were starving by the time our burgers were ready.</8>
<9>If you don't go to Primanti's were you really in Pittsburgh? We had to try it, so we stopped in and split one of these giant sandwiches. We had the New Yorker. I'm glad we split it, because these are monster sandwiches! The lettuce and tomato were welcome here and freshened everything up, and the soft bread was the perfect squishable vehicle for all of the toppings. We got extra spicy beer mustard which I'd definitely recommend- the acidity really helps to cut through all of the rich meats! Tasty sandwich, and the total cost for the 2 of us was around $10! Worth a try once!</9>
<10>This place is just ok. Nothing fancy, nothing amazing. Just ok. I got the sirloin steak salad, which was overcooked meat thrown on top of iceburg lettuce some shredded cheddar a few veggies and a LOT of French fries. Not sure if I missed something, but I don't remember reading that this salad came with a huge wad of fries on top. The wife got the boneless honey BBQ wings which she liked. For my kid, we ordered a bean burger, which we know came with fries, but we expected them to be on the side. The sandwich was literally a VERY thin bean patty squished into bread then a huge heap of coleslaw and fries were on top. Since my kiddo just ate the tiny patty, we basically wasted all the rest of the food. Like I said, the food was fine, but nothing special. The wait staff was very friendly, which helped, but sadly, I don't think we'll be back. Oh and I added a pic of the salad, which had a random piece of pastrami in it. Thanks, but really no thanks for that unwanted sample.</10>
<11>You can't stop in Pittsburgh without stopping at Primantis! There's just something surprisingly delicious about a beef patty topped with tomato, lettuce, Cole slaw, FRIES nestled between two pieces of white bread! This a Pittsburgh thing but more restaurants should serve something similar.This is by far the best $8 lunch I've had.</11>
<12>I haven't had Primanti since I lived in Pittsburgh in 1994.  I am driving up from SC in 2 weeks and plan on having Primanti Bros for at least 3 meals in 2 days!  I have been dreaming about this sandwich for 26 years!!!</12>
<13>When I came to visit Pittsburgh, I obviously wanted to do some Pittsburgh-y things. Primanti Bros was probably one of the top restaurants I wanted to visit. It was definitely everything and more that I was hoping for!  We came right around lunchtime on a Saturday, and I was honestly surprised at how empty it was. Maybe we just got lucky, or maybe they are busier during the week since they are in a business district. We were seated right away and given quick service.  Being first timers, we weren't really sure how big the portions would be, if we should order sides, etc.. Let me tell you, we both could had split a sandwich. It was gigantic!   We both got the Pittsburgher, as it was tabled to be one of their popular sandwiches, and it was wonderful, and very unique! Topped with french fries, too! We also split an order of the Terror Tots, which are tots covered in cheese, sriracha and jalepenos.. a great choice for spicy lovers!   Primanti Bros is for sure a place you need to try when in the city. It's nothing like I've ever had before!</13>
<14>Everyone knows that when you visit Pittsburgh, you have to try one of Primanti Brothers' famous sandwiches.  My coworker and I were in town last week for a business conference, and we had let our husbands tag along, so during our lunchtime break the four of us trekked over to check the place out.  I thought they were good sandwiches overall - they were packed with meat, cheese, a vinegar-based slaw, a slice or two of tomato, and of course - their signature fries.  The only thing my pastrami sandwich was lacking was some sort of sauce because it was a bit dry for my taste.  The parmesan horseradish sauce that came with the retro tots would have been great with the pastrami, so I would definitely ask for that if I ever make it there again.  My only other complaint would be that the tots weren't very hot when they came out, but that didn't stop me from eating as many as I could.I'm happy to have had the chance to try Primanti's after hearing about it for years.  You should definitely try it for yourself next time you're in town.</14>
<15>My first month in Pittsburgh and probably had half a dozen people recommend Primantis as the shrine for a quintessential Pittsburgh food experience. So off course I had to see what the fuss was about. So, worth the hype.... ehh..lets talkThe whole premise of this joint is about these gargantuan, french fries and slaw stacked "sandwiches" (In quotes coz in reality they're more of a handheld MEAL). So I gave one a shot - Pastrami with Cheese, and an Egg as extra.The sandwich at the outset is BIG, not awesome big though, like you'd find at the legendary Katz in NYC. The issue I had with it was the ratio of items on there. Rather miniscule portion of meat, diminutive cheese serving, massive slobbing of cole slaw and a mound of french fries, all being barely held in place by a thick white sandwich bread-slice. Oh and dont even get me started about the so called Tomatoes on there, I actually lost them in all this fluff!Once you start eating this "meal", you quickly realize that 85% of the taste you're getting is basically the french fries and slaw. You barely get to appreciate/unappreciate their meat or anything else on it (Case in point, the Extra Egg I had ordered on it). So in the end, you're basically left with a feeling of having had a rather Big Potato and Slaw sandwich. Nopes not what I envisioned and paid for. And what makes things worse is as you take your time to pound through this hulk of a sandwich, the French fries have gotten all cold and soggy. This further spoils the flavor and I ended up throwing quite a few of those.In the end, my stomach was indeed full (Thats a lot of potato in there) but completely unsatisfied. I'm glad I DID get to try this Pittsburgh staple but yeah no big deal.</15>
<16>I was on a business trip to Pittsburgh and my coworkers would not stop talking about this restaurant. After eating there, I completely understand the hype. Everything from the food to the large selection of beer made for such a good time! Keep in mind, this place is awesome for a great lunch, dinner and drinks with friends, and even a solo beer night. I can't wait to go back!</16>
<17>I haven't met a Primanti's location I didn't like -- from suburban ones to the original location in the Strip District -- and this one was no exception.  Being located in Bakery Square means that this particular Primanti's is in the heart of downtown, which is fun. Stopped in for apps + a drink before an event on the North Shore with one of my friends, and we have different taste in Primanti's sandwiches (she goes veggie burger, I'm a die-hard Cheese steak and egg girl)  so unfortunately we weren't able to have sandwiches. However the fried pickles were good -- they're spears, not chips like most places. We also had chicken tenders with Primanti's famous fries.The star of the show was definitely the ducky drink though. It's a fishbowl drink -- definitely plenty for the two of us to split on a casual drinks and apps night. And it even had a cute rubber ducky for us to take home :)</17>
<18>I was recommended to try this place while in Pittsburgh. Being that I don't eat the meats, I wonder how a veggie burger/sandwich will be executed. This place was not too bad. A short walk from my hotel, this place is easy to find, however, the sign says to wait outside for someone to seat you, and no one came, so we went inside. We sat where we wanted... Anyway, the lady was super helpful, answered all the questions. I ordered the black bean burger and tots, cause I love potatoes! They came out first piping hot, and delicious. Mind you, fries come on the sandwich, but I didn't care. Out comes the sandwich and the thing is huge. No plates, it's served by hand in paper. I was just thinking I would definitely drop one if I worked there. Hot sauce was passed on to us, however i wanted to try without first, to see how I like it. The combo of sourdough break, black bean burger, fries, tomato, and the slaw wasn't all that bad. I added hot sauce just to add a little spice to it. I could only eat half, and took the other half with me. The price was decent as well considering the location downtown. Staff were friendly. Only might want to head inside if you're waiting too long outside. :)</18>
<19>If you want fancy food, not the place. If you're looking for a good Reuben or one of their signature sandwiches, you won't be disappointed. I had the Carnegie and it was so good (and a beast)! I could only eat half of it because it was massive. The other half still tasted good for lunch the day after. My buddy had wings (whyyyyy!?!? ‍) and they were mediocre. Food comes out quickly and they were able to accommodate a group of 8 with minimal wait time. Would recommend for a casual outing.</19>
<20>Yeah you could eat fries separately but putting them in the sandwich is bold and nobody else is doing it. I like it! So many choices on the menu. Possibly the best item on it was the mozzarella triangles. They serve it with marinara sauce but just set that aside. You're in Pittsburgh, pour on some of that Heinz ketchup and you'll see the truth of what I'm talking about. For my main meal I decided on the Kielbasa & Cheese. Fresh bread mad it look thicker than it really was. With a little effort I was able to take a bite.I also tried the XXspicy boneless hot wings. Proceed at your own risk.</20>
<21>You absolutely cannot come to Pittsburgh and NOT have Primanti Brothers....that would be UNHEARD of!! This restaurant is a staple to my hometown and I always make my way there when I visit. The sandwiches are unique & filling. I am a huge fan of the corn beef and cheese. (This is the only time I refuse to follow a vegan diet!! It's essentially impossible) This place is an experience in and of itself and you will certainly feel right at home here. Make sure yinz visit when you are in the Burgh :)</21>

<1>Stopped in for breakfast yesterday. All restaurants are closed for indoor seating due to the pandemic but Caffe Mona has a charming outdoor seating area. We were quickly seated. All employees were wearing masks and the tables and chairs were all cleaned between customers. I ordered the protein omelette with side salad, everything was great! My husband had a bagel sandwich and fruit plate. The fruit plate was amazing so fresh and everything from plums and pears to fresh cherries . They serve breakfast all day and have a huge variety of crepes on the menu, sweet and savory. Love this spot!</1>
<2>Exceeded my expectations! Upon arriving was told there was a 5 minute wait to sit outside (to ensure social distance) while we waited he offered everyone free water bottles. It was super hot we were were so thankful. The place was so cute, loved the rainbow umbrellas outside! The sweet crepe was amazing! I had the Nutella love! My friend had the avo toast and she loved it as well!</2>
<3>My first visit was before Covid just to get a quick coffee but the barista was so welcoming I stayed and enjoyed my coffee. On my second trip, I sat on the back patio with a friend under the umbrellas. The food, service, and atmosphere were all awesome.</3>
<4>If you love Nutella this is your spot. Probably the cutest patio in Pittsburgh with colorful umbrellas above you. Fast, efficient service and crepes that are to die for I got a coffee and the Nutella lover crepe, which was jam packed with strawberries, bananas, blueberries and walnuts. Anyone who says this is pricey is wrong because they are HUGE and STUFFED to the brim. Highly recommend and can't wait to try more menu items!</4>
<5>This pace can get crowded and have a wait so get there early! I recommend sitting on their upstairs patio if you can. Especially if the pandemic is still going on. They have rainbow umbrellas hung up and it's super cute.Club Bagel Sandwich - a simple classic that tasted great. You can get a plain bagel or an everything bagel. Breakfast Crepe - I could have totally eaten this as a meal! It was so good! It's a bit small and comes with a few grapes so I get why it's a starter. The egg yolk pops and adds some fun and flavor to the dish.</5>
<6>Terrible espresso. Extremely burnt flavor.OK bagels and basic breakfast sandwiches. Actual entrees are very bland, unbalanced combinations of ingredients of mediocre quality and little flavor. Same goes for the specialty breakfast sandwiches sold like entrees.Atmosphere is cozy.</6>
<7>The outdoor seating here is awesome and great for a weekend brunch, especially since there aren't a lot of dine-in options right now. The food is amazing and the brunch special allows you to try a couple different things. I will say that this seems to be a popular spot and, because of that, I think service could improve. There didn't seem to be a lot of communication between waitresses (one took our order and then another came ready to take our order again). I had the $20 brunch special with an iced coffee, fruit plate, polish hill crepe (basically a huge pierogi) and Nutella banana crepe. My savory crepe was supposed to come with a side salad, but it was so busy I didn't think it was worth asking about. Every single thing was delicious and I'd definitely come back just for the food alone.</7>
<8>Came here for the CUTE patio, but was so pleasantly SURPRISED by everything else! My friend and I each got a Brunch Special which included a drink, fruit/ salad, any entree on the menu, and a dessert crepe - all for $20.I had the iced chai latte, fruit plate, philly cheese steak crepe, and banana nutella crepe. They give you SO MUCH food. Everything was so FRESH, so DELICIOUS and 1 Brunch Special was definitely enough to split between 2 people. Still can't believe I didn't know about this spot until today. Go check them out if you haven't already!!! AhhLastly, I'm only giving 4 stars and not 5 because the service was very average. At the end of our meal, I felt like we got rushed out the door. He kept saying "let's go! let's go!" to get us to pay while we were still midbite.</8>
<9>I really enjoyed the food and decor at Caffe Mona. I came with a friend on a Sunday morning around 10am. All the servers were wearing masks and distancing was followed. Overall the food was very good and there were a lot of options to choose from. Unfortunately, the servers made us feel rather rushed. We didn't go more than 3 or 4 minutes without a server asking us if we were ready for the next step in the process. We didn't seem to have a dedicated server, which was fine, however this led to nonstop inquires as to if we were ready to move on. Towards the end, my friend was finishing her meal with food still on her plate and we had already been asked if we were ready to leave about 5 times and one of the servers was just standing watching us asking how we were going to pay (you pay at the front so this inquiry was strange). It made us very uncomfortable considering she was still eating! We were there for under an hour so it is not as though we had overstayed our time allotment. I think the intentions were good to have attentive servers but it led to a negative result.</9>
<10>Hidden gem !!!Cozy place, attentive stuff and so goood breakfast/ brunch food! We had savory and sweet crapes and lattes. Very good combination of ingredients, big portion, fresh fruits. Make sure you check this place out with friends  and family.</10>
<11>The spanikopita french was AMAZING. You MUST TRY. We brought our own bottle of champagne and got orange juice. The strawberry Nutella crepe hit the spot. And the omlet was light and fluffy. Definitely exceeded my expectations. Service was great as well.</11>
<12>Came here on a weekday for breakfast - parking was not easy (being right across from the hospital) so  if you can Uber/walk id recommend that!Ambiance - cozy and quirky with lots of random art work. Has a patio which looks like it's be great in the summer. Friendly service. Food - came here for brunch with kids and adults. Perfect balance of sweet and savory options. I got the 3 course meal for $20. First course was a GIANT fruit place perfect for sharing with the whole table and the third course was a dessert option also perfect for sharing. For me entree had the savory cafe crepe which was pretty good - not amazing but I def finished it. Other food - the Berries French toast came with unexpected gummy bears which was odd but the rest was very tasty. Overall 3 for food but the giant fruit plate and the ambiancd brought it up to a 4. Overall large quantity with sweet and savory options. Get the 3 course to share.</12>
<13>Hi Sohini, Thank you for your feedback, hope to see you again soon</13>
<14>Very cute cafe convenient to Children's Hospital. Their brunch is excellent, so make sure you look at their $20 3 course deal. I've always loved their fruit plate, which is large enough to share. The crepes are very good, both savory and sweet. Plenty of vegetarian options. Over the many years I've been here, the service may slip a little, especially if busy, but on the whole, this is a fun place to go with group. They serve bottled water, which I'm not a fan of, due to ecological concerns, so I wish they would rethink that policy. There's outdoor seating in the back.</14>
<15>Amazing employees, great atmosphere for both in and outdoor dining. Huge plates and everything is extremely delicious! Definitely best brunch place in Pittsburgh!</15>
<16>This place had a kitchen issue the day that I went. The service went down hill during our visit. Let me explain....We were here for homecoming for The University of Pittsburgh and we were interested to try the restaurants in the new areas they revitalized. We saw this restaurant and it had decent reviews so we thought why not. We had a larger party and they were able to accommodate us fine. We were a group of 8. I will like to fairly note that we came at different waves. Half of us came first. Then two more and two others. We made our order and it started off fine. They were about 75% full. As we all came we ordered at different times. The timing of the food and the response by the staff is what brought my rating down. The food came at weird times. I recall my friend that came later than the friend that was here first got her food before her. Things like that. There were a slew of mix ups like this and they tried accusing us of their mistakes than just apologizing and moving forward. They said that we accepted the wrong dish that was meant for someone else. What????? You handed the person the entree and blamed us? I feel like a lot of people in the restaurant ordered similar things so they were all confused. They asked me several times if something was meant for our table but it was nothing we ordered. Side note: a tv with football on was in the kitchen. The staffing may have been off today, but the person that looked like the manager did not treat my friend who had the food mix up with great customer service. For the food, I got their $20 brunch combo that included a coffee, entree and crepe. It is a pretty good deal for what you get. I got the vegetable omelette, and the strawberry and Nutella crepe. I thought it was a good meal. Just too bad about the service.</16>
<17>My wife and I love Caffe Mona! The food is fantastic (love the savory creoe options personally), and the service is great. We live their outdoor deck with the colorful umbrellas. They've catered and hosted events for our church too. Their owners were amazing to work with. They went above and beyond for everything we needed.</17>
<18>My friends and I love trying out new brunch places on the weekends! Cafe Mona has officially made it to the top of our list. We loved the outdoor patio with the umbrellas and of course the food was amazing! I ordered the Nutella Classic pancakes and split the Mediterranean omelet. They have such a great variety of sweet and savory options that will make everyone happy!</18>
<19>We had a wonderful brunch here today. My daughter couldn't decide on which of the many delicious items on the menu to order so she ordered two! Including an omelette and a chocolate Nutella crepe. We found the service and the friendliness amazing - would highly recommend this venue. It's very charming with the rainbow umbrellas too.</19>
<20>This aesthetically pleasing restaurant is great! The atmosphere there is always cozy but also lively and I always find myself suggesting to go there with my friends and family because of how hospitable and welcoming the staff is, you can tell that they go out of their way to make their customers' experiences good and memorable -which has always been the case for me- not to mention the delicious food ofcourse and the gorgeous indoor and outdoor decor that's inspired by the cute cafes in Istanbul. All in all, this place is highly recommended.</20>
<21>We were visiting our daughter in Pittsburgh.  She took us to one of her favorite places for breakfast- Caffe Mona. The food was delicious, the people were really nice and it had such a fun atmosphere!  We highly recommend it.</21>

<1>First time today Excellent drinks Appetizers to die for Deserts  are great Coffee press coffee Best happy hour</1>
<2>Such a warm, cozy, fun spot. Had Caesar salads, bison burgers, and salmon on the table... everyone was impressed with their meals. Great speakeasy vibe and service was fast and accommodating. An awesome spot for a cocktail or a nice dinner!</2>
<3>Such a great atmosphere. It's a cozy little vibe good for drinks and hangout. Of course I just preface this review with the fact that I couldn't eat anything what so ever. No vegan options . "The coffee is super sexy." - Abby WassermanHeads up if you check-in you get a nice $4 off coupon for a fruit infused shot.  What you see below are all recommendations from friends I brunched with ( watch eat) Carmella's Breakfast - Delicious. It has bacon, brioche, eggs, and baked hash.  While it was very flavorful it wasn't hot at all.  The fact that the bread is grilled is interesting.  In fact it also has a "burgery" smell Steak and Egg Tostado - 10/10 This friend loves it so much and each time she comes she always order it and is never disappointed.  I can admit it looked and smelled absolutely delicious.  Breakfast sandwich - It was delicious.  Also said that they wish the food was hot, particularly the baked hash. It was a high end meat. The bacon was a very thick cut.  Pros: - Relaxed vibe - Great service Cons: - No vegan options obviously - They have dessert options but they are on a completely different menu so I didn't get the chance to check it out because I didn't see it.  Would definitely come back for a chill drink at the bar. Happy Brunch'in</3>
<4>I've indulge in drinks here  before but I've never tried their dinner menu before. I love Carmella's decor and atmosphere. We were lucky enough to be able  to seat about the fire place table which was wonderful!A friend and I went for restaurant week so we got to chose three courses from a prefixed menu. For my first course I choose the arancini balls. The fried outer shell balanced great with the soft middle.For my entree I got the lamb shank which was delicious! However, I did have order envy because my friend ordered the duck and it was amazing. For dessert I got the raspberry hand pie. It was good dessert but not spectacular.I will definitely be back to Carmella's to try there regular dinner menu!</4>
<5>So glad this place was open for our late ish arrival on a road trip recently. We called ahead and they allowed us to order while still driving in to town so their kitchen could close on time AND we could still dine there. Food was fantastic (especially the scallops) and our server was great. She even gave us local pro tips when we asked for them. Great experience and service!</5>
<6>I will start this review by saying I am so excited for the next time I visit. My whole experience was excellent from the start! I'm becoming more impressed with the Southside's offerings. This is definitely not a cheap, greasy establishment like the ones I've become accustomed to in the area. Carmella's is refined and comfortable. I visited Carmella's during restaurant week and was not disappointed at all. The arancini ball was crispy all around and the inside was a somewhat moist with sprinkles of delicious sausage throughout. The tomato sauce that topped it added a tart balance. The bacon wrapped duck was amazing. The duck was cooked perfectly, it was so juicy and fatty with the right amount of salt. I would totally go back for the dish alone. It was amazing. The blueberry hand pie was ok. It wasn't bad, I was just envious of my friend's raspberry hand pie because I found it to be more tart and it even had ice cream! If you're looking for a cozy refuge away from Southside's usual chaos, come to Carmella's. The happy hour specials seemed decent  and the food is great!</6>
<7>I came out with a large group on a Friday night and the service and food were great.  Our waitress was bubbly and friendly and helpful.  I ordered the gnocchi as a main dish and it was delicious.  It was enough food to satisfy me, but not stuff me.  I heard nothing bad said about any of the food from any of the other people I was with.  The portions seemed large and satisfying.  I ordered the basil smash as my drink and it was very good and an appropriate amount of alcohol for me.  All the drinks looked fun and yummy.  The decor is very interesting and definitely fits with a theme.  I would call it "prohibition lodge".  The bar and dining area are separate spaces, which was really great for our group, so we could still have conversations in the back area.  It was kind of dark though.  Overall, I'd give it 4.5 stars, but chose to round up.  I think it was great and would definitely eat there again if I were out and about in the southside.</7>
<8>Carmella's feels like that traditional, local pub where you could have a hearty meal on a date night, meet your parents for an early bird dinner, or catch up with an old friend over drinks and apps. I did the latter a couple months ago before a show at The Rex Theater. I arrived a few minutes before my friend and was being indecisive about my drink selection. I felt that the bartenders were a bit aloof, more interested in personal conversation with each other than making sure that the customers were all content. They weren't rude, but I thought service left something to be desired.I had a tasty Moscow Mule and enjoyed drinking it from a beautiful copper mug. My friend and I then split the Duck Fat Fries, Crispy Brussels, and Mac and Cheese. The Crispy Brussels were the clear winner of the bunch with the Mac and Cheese coming in a close second.I struggled with how to rate Carmella's. In some ways, I wanted to give it 3 stars for its somewhat stodgy, dated decor, mediocre service, and my lack of excitement to return in the future. But then, I also considered giving the restaurant 5 stars for the quality of beverage and food that I consumed. For that reason, I felt that 4 stars really reflects my full range of emotions regarding this restaurant, but make sure to try a number of menu items while here to enjoy the full experience.</8>
<9>This is a little cozy spotTraveling with my team we dropped in for some good food.The fried deviled eggs was different, in order to get the true blend of all the ingredients you have to eat the entire egg together. Not my favorite, but glad I tried itHanger Steak was cook great I was hoping the steak was a lot bigger. The secret sauce is really what gives this meal the great flavor. Brussel sprouts were really good with the bacon, a must try. The drawback, took to long to get our food. Not a bad spot but could be better.</9>
<10>My wife and I have been in the sticks in PA and it was an amazing experience. This place is clean and well designed. The octopus's was tender and delicious and the pappardelle was sooooo good. The drinks are fun and the whiskey and tequila list is to die for. Our service was great. The only problem we had was that the gnocchi came out looking like Vienna sausage and tasting nothing like gnocchi but the broth and veggies were wonderful. Best of luck and we will return if ever in Pittsburgh.</10>
<11>Awesome spot for happy hour and food. Met up with a friend for a quick bite and really had a hard time choosing what to order from the menu with so many delicious options to choose from. Ended up starting off with the gnocchi (cooked in a creamy sauce, topped with perfect bite sized prosciutto crunch bits, Parmesan cheese, and a delectable lemon zest that was noticeable yet not overpowering) and the grilled salmon (crisped skin, served with a Francaise sauce over a bed of creamy risotto). For comfort food that is cooked to perfect, stop by this place!</11>
<12>After years of wanting to check this place out, I finally did... and was super impressed! I stopped here for a few drinks, and appetizers.. but can not wait to come back for dinner.The space itself is lovely. Contemporary, but historic (space used to be an old beauty parlor) the bar is beautifully decorated and well lit (and they have tons of booze) nice wine and beer selection, and even have a massive Moscow mule (4 people minimum) which seems super fun. The bartender was very nice, and the patrons around us were fantastic as well. This place just has a great feel!The food that we got was not a huge portion but they were prepared perfectly. The "devilish eggs" are a must try! And their Brussel sprouts were out of this works. I will definitely be back! ----I updated my review on dinner experience. I wasn't very happy with the bar items, and to be honest I thought my salmon would have been better. If I didn't have such a great first experience I may have had to give a 3 star.</12>

<14>We had our anniversary dinner at Carmella's and it was amazing!! Mussels & oysters for apps, meatloaf & a burger for entree and 2 delicious desserts. We couldn't have been more happy with the food and service. We will definitely be coming back!</14>
<15>Came in on a Sunday afternoon for brunch. We we're seated promptly even though we did not have reservations. The waiter was super nice and had excellent service. I ordered the fried chicken sandwich with duck fat fries and the food was fantastic! It did take a bit for the food to come out but it was perfected. Definitely will stop by here again for brunch!</15>
<16>Carmella's is prob my staple for the last few years. I have honestly never had a bad experience at Carmella's. This is one of my favorites in South Side for a great cocktail and no college kids. The atmosphere is inviting and cozy. Service is always great. I have never had a bad drink here and the food is so good as well. Some must haves in my book:- strawberry jalapeño infused tequila on the rocks with a splash of soda water - they have a strawberry jalapeño margarita but I'm not a sweet drink person so I prefer on the rocks. - Creole Mac and Cheese-Crispy Brussels - Lemon Preserve Gnocchi-Lobster and shrimp Cajun Mac and cheese - not on menu it's a special - Bison Burger   I can just about say that Carmella's will not disappoint.</16>
<17>Carmella has been a mainstay of the Southside bar scene for longer than I've lived in Pittsburgh, so it's probably safe to say she knows what she's doing. She's also been a big part of an annual charity bar crawl for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, so this is a place that deserves your business.  I'd been wanting to come here for their brunch for awhile now and finally made it in recently.The vibe and decor is, I don't know, outdoorsy Victorian era? There was a conscious decision here as to what they were going for. It's a neat atmosphere. No complaints about our server.The coffee is all French pressed, so it's a little more pricey than you'd pay for a cup somewhere else, but you can taste where your money went. I talked myself into getting the banana old fashioned, and it was worth it. They've got all the standard brunch drinks plus a few specialties. If you're here during non-breakfast hours, their selection of spirits is probably better than any other place in the neighborhood.I had the chicken and waffles, which was very good, but didn't blow me away. The waffles were blueberry and served with the standard butter and syrup. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food. I'd love to try some other options next time but I didn't even get a look at the dinner menu.I'm not one to venture into the Southside on the weekends after dark, so I'll probably stick to weeknights or brunch here, but I'm pretty sure I'll be back.</17>
<18>Stopped in here last night with a girlfriend to catch up! It's the Christmas season and it just felt so warm, cozy and festive in here! I just loved the decor - we sat in the bar but the back room look welcome and cozy with a fire place!!We had a few rounds of wine and split a chopped salad and a cheese board! Will definitely come back here to try more of the delicious looking menu items. The service was fantastic too! Our drinks never went empty, and we didn't feel rushed at all!</18>
<19>We stopped here for Sunday brunch on our way from from a weekend get away.  What a pleasant surprise we had.  Our waiter, Ben, was awesome.  He took his time explaining the menu and was attentive.  My wife ordered the breakfast sandwich while I had the steak and egg tostada.  Both were delicious.  The hanger steak was done perfectly with a chili rub.  The mixed drink menu is interesting and the Bloody Mary was excellent.  We found out that Carmella's has live music (acoustic guitar) from 3-6 on Sundays.  We extended our stay in town just  to go back and enjoy a few small plates while we enjoyed the entertainment.  They also have 125 bourbons to choose from.  We will definitely go back the next time we are in town.</19>
<20>The food here is great! We came in for brunch on a Sunday morning and didn't need a reservation and got a table right away! I got the southern fried chicken sandwich and it was great! The only downside is that they don't have dance which would have gone great with the chicken sandwich! We also got mimosa which were great and the service here was also pretty good! I am exited to try other dishes here!</20>
<21>So disclaimer: I came in here for brunch/breakfast and have never been in for dinner or the bar so this is just a review of the brunch. The decor is pretty interesting, very  old school tavern with moose heads on the wall and a fireplace in the middle of the room. The coffee was probably the coolest part, it came in a French press that you did yourself but our waitress never specified which roast was which. Both tasted pretty much the same so it was either the wrong order or both roasts are very very similar. Oh well, it was still cool. I got the Carmella's breakfast and the plate looked impressive. The good: the susage, bacon, and eggs were great. The odd: it came with hash browns but they were really spicy cheesy potatoes which had I know that I wouldn't have ordered it, and when I asked for some more jam for my toast I got just a little bit of jam and a big dollop of butter when all I wanted was jam. My boyfriend had the chicken and waffles and while the chicken was very good the waffles were blueberry which I thought was odd. In summary, the service was a little iffy and I wish the menus was a little more specific but everything otherwise was ok.</21>

<description>No Discription</description>
<reviews>
<1>This is one of my favorite lunch places near my office in Oakland.  It's a family run place and the service is always consistent and very efficient, even when they are busy. They have excellent Korean dishes and sushi options at reasonable prices. The fish is always very fresh.  There are some tables upstairs for dine-in but I usually get take-out.  They have re-opened for takeout since the COVID-19 restrictions and I have felt very safe getting food there, as all employees have been following COVID related precautions.</1>
<2>I went here for lunch a couple of times and found the food to be excellent, and Korean food is hard to find here in Pittsburgh.  I've had the bi bim bap, the beef bul go gi and one of their sushi rolls and everything was prepared well and reasonably priced.  There isn't much seating so people generally take order to go but the orders are prepared pretty quickly.</2>
<3>100% in my top 3 for both Korean and Japanese food in the city. Their katsudon is to die for and pretty much any of their bowls are just as good. I will say their sushi is good but not knock your socks off amazing like some of their other dishes. I'd say they were probably my 1st or 2nd choice for Korean dishes alongside BaeBae's Kitchen. You must go. It's got a good atmosphere and fast delivery.</3>
<4>Fantastic restaurant that delivers in tasty food, quantity of food (ALOT of food), and price of the food--a true culinary triple threat. I ordered the chicken katsu bento box and it was phenomenal. The best part of the bento box is the amount of food that includes sides, rice, and the a generous portion of meat. Overall great Japanese cuisine and I will definitely order from here again. I want to reiterate that it is one of the few places in Pittsburgh that truly delivers on what we all want from a restaurant: a cheap meal that is delicious and plentiful. Extremely fast delivery as well. Worth every penny. A true hidden gem.</4>
<5>While we were in OaklandJake and I grabbed some dinnerLotta good optionsBut we went with OISHII BENTO        . ...My favorite Korean style food in Pittsburgh      .          We ordered, patiently waited outside, and the worker inside     .            brought us our foodTo me      .            nothing comes closeTo theirkatsu bentos...Reminds me of homeI ate...Thoroughly enjoyed itDelicious    .                    ...indeedありがとう     .           .                                                      ...</5>
<6>We ordered from here via DoorDash for a group picnic! The food arrived on time and was nicely packaged so that there were no major spills or leaks. Everyone really like their food!</6>
<7>Conveniently located in Oakland, this is probably one of my favorite places to quickly grab lunch or dinner. Their upstairs dining area is pretty decent. It's ideal if you dont have too much time to spare for your meal. I usually get their Spicy pork bento, which is such a steal- a lot of portion for a good price! My friend also loves their Chicken Katsu bowl. I have yet to try their other menu!</7>
<8>Oishii Bento pretty much stands as one of the few pillars available for korean food in Pittsburgh. Their dishes are always well priced, especially for bulgogi and LA Galbi seeing as there are no H-Marts, Lotte Marts, or any other major korean grocery within a 2-3 hr drive to buy fresh/non-frozen meat from. The udon here is pretty good as well, especially with the variety of vegetables they include in it. If you want to order for dinner, make sure to call 30min - 1hr in advance though on weekdays as they can get pretty busy with orders.</8>
<9>Came here for the first time for dinner.  Ordered the Hwe dup bop and my friend ordered the pork tonkatsu bento with a side of kimchi and miso soup and a bottle of water.  Total came out to around $30.What's Hot- Location.  It's in Oakland and conveniently located near other locations, which is helpful.- Menu variety.  There appears to be something for everyone- meats, tofu, seafood, and veggies.  There are bento boxes with rice, udon (noodle soup), sushi rolls, and appetizers.  Not bad.- Prices.  Pretty reasonable.  Because my dish has sashimi, it cost $15, which is more than the average dish.  However, that's not too expensive.  Their rolls that have raw fish cost more, as well, but that's to be expected.  My friend's pork tonkatsu box cost around $10, but it also came with a side (he chose miso soup), gyoza (fried potstickers), a few pieces of daikon (pickled radish), rice, and japcahe (Korean rice noodles).- Portions.  Both my dish and my friend's dish were a pretty good size.  Enough to make us full, but not stuffed.  What's Not- The sashimi was still slightly frozen.  There were 3 types of fish/sashimi in my bowl.  All 3 fish had ice crystals when I was eating.  This didn't allow me to taste the flavor of the sashimi very well.  Leads me to believe they're not very well prepared and it also leads me to believe if they use frozen fish in their sushi rolls.  It detracts from the quality of the food.- No seating on the first floor.  The only seating are a couple of benches for you to wait for your food, and short bar table with 2 high chairs.  It isn't much.  A couple other places on the same block have a decent seating area on the first floor.  Not this place.  Makes it difficult and cramped.- Wait time.  We waited over 15 minutes for our food, which technically isn't bad.  However, given the quality of the food, especially my sashimi, it wasn't worth it.  - Prices.  For the most part, the food is reasonably priced.  However, my friend ordered a side of kimchi for a couple of dollars and it came in a little container that's meant for sauce!  It was super tiny and definitely not enough.  This container was smaller than the dish that my sashimi sauce came in.  What's up with that?  For the most part, their prices seem reasonable, but I'm very hesitant to order some dishes for the sake of trying it.- Portions.  As I mentioned regarding the price of the side of kimchi, it is not worth $2 for an itty bitty side of kimchi.  While the portions of their dishes seem to be ok for the most part, it does not seem to apply to all their dishes.  Final AnswerWilling to come back, but not a first choice.</9>
<10>Cheap, filling Korean fast food that probably gives you all the food groupsyou need for a day. We ordered the katsu bento and the bulgogi bento, but they messed up our order unfortunately and sent us two katsu bentos. Bentos come with pickled radish (yellow), two potstickers, glass noodle (japchae), and a massive portion of katsu and rice that honestly can be enough for 2 meals. Great place for a college student in the area trying something out aside from the standard Chipotle.</10>
<11>Cheap, delicious, and filling! Came here for a quick lunch, and got an udon bowl to go for less than $8. Took around 5 minutes to get my food, and it definitely hit the spot. Would love to come back to try the bento boxes, katsu, and other menu items. Also, loved that they had free barley tea! Was exactly what I needed to warm up while waiting for my food on a cold and rainy day</11>
<12>My wife and I were strolling along Forbes and feeling a little hungry. We wanted something to share and this was perfect thing! For $9.00 this is a pretty decent amount of food and the wait wasn't terribly long either. :)The rice was a little dry (maybe it had been sitting too long), but the meal was served hot and the egg and beef were well cooked and well seasoned. Would love to come back and try more of the menu!</12>
<13>I read the reviews of this spot, and I was really excited to have Bento again. It's the kind of place where you place your order and then wait. The people behind the counter were not nice. The food took an eternity - like 25 minutes - to come, and I was super hungry. The price was expensive. The food was ok. Nothing to write home about. I was d</13>

<15>Whenever I have had a stressful week, I crave Oishii's Spicy Tofu Teriyaki bowl. The tofu is cooked perfectly and the sauce is delicious. I also love the spicy tofu teriyaki bento box, which comes with Japanese pickled radish, one side of your choosing, japchae, and dumplings. I can never finish it all but it is definitely the way to get the best bang for your buck, and it saves well. Oishii's bibimbab is also awesome!The employees are always nice and welcoming. It's usually busy and it takes a little while for them to prepare your food, so I recommend calling ahead for pick-up if you want to grab your food and go.</15>
<16>I had the bulgogi bento box.  Very solid tastes and the portion is nice.  The kimchi has a nice bite but I like mine a touch sweeter.</16>
<17>Had lunch for a few times. Tried udon once. Ordered beef bento for most of time. Very convenient.</17>
<18>The chicken katsu was amazing. It tasted delicious like the one I usually eat at home. Very good! Little small place with great food. Def one of the tastiest places on that block.</18>
<19>Good! We ordered two katso chicken boxes and shrimp kyoza. Kyoza was super tasty. Chicken was a bit bland/chewy, but the portions were generous!</19>
<20>Oishii is one of the better places to eat in Oakland and certainly the most reasonably priced/quickest place to get a decent Korean food fix.I've been here on multiple occasions and the food is satisfyingly consistent. My go-to is the Spicy Pork Bento which comes with a huge portion of rice, spicy-sweet pork, japchae (glass noodle dish), two fried dumplings, some radish, and your choice of kimchi, miso soup, or salad. I always go for salad because I like the dressing and it's refreshing with the rest of the meal! Though pricier than many other options in Oakland, the bento lasts me at least 2 (if not 3 meals when I add some kimchi or sides at home) which makes it well worth the price!It's usually crowded and buzzing on the ground floor to order with a pack of people waiting for takeout, but I've always been able to find a table in the small upstairs dining area. Pop upstairs and grab a table and some water or hot barley tea - your order might take a while and there's an additional screen upstairs for displaying order numbers ready for pickup.  Service is mostly limited to your order and transaction, so don't expect much - you're here for the food.For a quick meal to satisfy your comfort Korean food cravings or a budget-friendly place to meet up with friends, Oishii is a great pick!</20>
<21>Delicious fast Korean food! The bulgogi was sweet and juicy! Highly recommended! I tried the bulgogi bibimbap and bulgogi bento. For the bibimbap, first of all, it tasted good as a bibimbap. However, if you wanna try their signature bulgogi beef, you should not order this. The flavor of the meat was overriden by the bibimbap sauce and I guest the owner kept the bulgogi juice out of the bowl to keep the bibimbap flavor neat. So I like the bento better. In addition to many kinds of delicious sides, you can get the best taste out of the bulgogi.</21>
<22>Oishii will always be my go-to comfort food. I've tried a variety of their dishes but the Chicken Bowl will always be my favorite. Plus tax, it is around $7 and they give a very generous portion. Their Bulgogi Bowl is also really good. I wouldn't recommend getting their sushi- it's good but nothing special.  They have a small seating area upstairs so it is pretty limited. It is usually busy during meal times but the wait is definitely worth it. They also provide free barley tea!</22>

<title>Burgatory</title>
<description>Helluva Burger + Heavenly Shakes…</description>
<reviews>
<1>We wanted to switch it up for take-out & decided to try out the Burgatory in the North Shore. We called ahead & picked up. Super easy. We waited outside, safely distanced from others. Service was friendly & pick-up was easy. Food was packed up very nicely & it tasted fresh & delicious! Will order again.</1>
<2>Great food, great drinks, and safe was very friendly. Both in door and outside seating and all safe was taking COVID 19 seriously.</2>
<3>Great location close to the stadium and the Science Center. It's surpassingly large once you get inside. The menu is consistent with other Burgatory locations. My personal fave is the burger with guacamole, or veggie burger. And the fries are delicious!Service here was super friendly and attentive, despite being very busy. I made a comment about how busy they were, and the waitress said it was always busy. So be sure to plan ahead or leave early... it's worth it!</3>
<4>Everything that could go wrong went wrong and ruined my whole experience with this location!I had Burgatory just 2 days ago at the Waterfront location with amazing service and food but I can't say the same with this location and staff.I had a group of people with me and we called ahead for reservations which they allowed us to do, so we came 5-10 mins early before our scheduled time and checked in. They proceeded to tell us they weren't ready for us exactly yet so we waited patiently since we were slightly early. 20 mins past our time and the table still wasn't ready. Then called us 5 mins later to say it was ready then told us once we walked in it wasn't ready and waited another 10 mins. Wasn't going to complain since it was durning rush hour. As we got to the table and sat down, we ordered pretty fast since we were extremely hungry. The appetizers came out and they looked good! I didn't eat any because I just wanted a burger. When the burgers came out I was excited to indulge in the juicy Custom Elk burger. I was extremely disappointed when it came out extremely well done when asked for a pink center for a medium rare burger. They took it back and remade it for me. While the other were finishing their burger my burger comes out looking good again and I take a big bite to find the middle completely raw. Now I'm extremely disgusted and ruined my whole appetite of wanting a burger. Another server came over and offered to have it remake it for me again but I was so over even having a burger at this point. Didn't even offer to bring me a menu to even overlook the menu for an idea of something else. Sorry but I don't memorize restaurant menus I've only been to twice.Meanwhile while sitting at the table we had to wave down our sever to get any attention since she never came by to check on us or to even offer to get us more water since all the cups on that table were empty for the longest time. Had to beg her to get us some more water.Since I didn't want another burger I decided to get a chicken sandwich ToGo since I couldn't trust them to make me a proper burger. Which I had to pull up the website on my phone to look at a menu to order something since the server wouldn't come around to even allow me to ask for a menu. I ordered a shake with my group to enjoy something with them and called it a night. The server Lacey needs to cater to all her tables equally for everyone to have a better experience and the manager needs to be aware of order mistakes and at least talk with the guest to ensure their experience isn't ruined. I know how a restaurant should be ran and this was a poorly ran location from the host, to server, to the kitchen and topping it off with the manager. Need to go back and retrain the whole restaurant on how guest satisfaction is the number 1 rule when it comes to the service industry.</4>
<5>We've been wanting to try Burgatory for a while, and since today was such a beautiful day we decided to take a long hike down the Three Rivers Heritage Trail and hit up Burgatory's North Shore location for lunch. We got there a couple of minutes after eleven and got seated on the patio. There were two other occupied tables there. In other words, it was not crowded by any means. Two servers appeared several times to handle the other tables, and although both of them looked right at us as they went back and forth, neither asked if we were being helped. We gave it fifteen minutes before we left. The manager ran out after us, apologizing, offering comps, and saying that there were normally three servers handling the patio after we told him why we were leaving. So there's no teamwork. No one tells another that a table needs service, or takes it upon themselves to ask a table if it's been served. Got it.I am not in the habit of giving bad reviews here, or trying to score freebies, but there was zero excuse for us to sit on a practically empty patio on a Sunday morning and not even get asked about a drink order, while nearby tables got multiple server visits in that same time period. ZERO. Burgatory's food may be awesome,  but I sincerely hope that today was an exception and not the norm for its service.</5>
<6>Burger was decent and service was good. Just have to mention that charging 1.60 per onion ring is a bit excessive. When I ordered $10 onion rings I assumed it was enough to share... but when I found a box with 6 onion rings I was very disappointed...Especially since it's onion rings and a whole onion costs about $1  smh ... also there were two delicious sauces provided with the 6 onion rings, but who needs 2 sauces when there's not even enough rings for 1.</6>
<7>4 strikes and you are out. I used to love Burgatory. I wanted to love it, that's why we kept ordering it. BUT they have gotten my order wrong 4 TIMES in a row ordering delivery. We will never order from here again.</7>
<8>The absolute best place for burgers and veggie burgers! Sooo good and I live how you can customize everything. We've never had a bad experience here.</8>
<9>I have been a fan of Burgatory because of the quality of food. I ordered through door dashed today and my burger arrived "ice cold" and my order was wrong (see pic).  I requested "no pink"  when ordering and it was plenty pink.   I cant blame Burgatory for the cold burger because I noticed my dasher when he arrived had several orders in his front seat and had to look for mine!!!?  The restaurant is 10 minutes away from me!??   Slightly warm would have even been ok but it was so obvious the burger was sitting for a while.  That is why there was delay which resulted in my very cold burger.    An indication on my app "preparing order" was on my screen for such a long time I even sent a message to my dasher - it was only then that my food arrived within 10 minutes - ice cold of course.   What a waste of $ and expensive lunch was that was pits!  Never again will I order food through Door Dash to this restaurant. If I was at the restaurant I could have returned the un-cooked burger.</9>
<10>This location is spacious and really like that there is plenty of booth seating.  I love this setup!  The seating at the robinson location is too close together.   I prefer to have some type of distance between myself and others that are in the restaurant.  Our visit was around lunch time 12:30.   I was surprised we didn't have to wait for a table, however; we did wait about 20 minutes for our food.    I got my usual burger (custom - pictured) and it was delicious as always.  I love the selection of fries especially the Truffled Gorgonzola for $8.00.  Perfect size to share! $5.00 Parking in the closest lot.   I look forward to my next visit.</10>
<11>I recommend....HOWEVER  I was EXTREMELY disappointed Sunday September 20 2020 6 55 PM by the unpleasant and rude demeanor from the curbside pick up hostess . She displayed ZERO people/customer service  skills...ZERO...we were treated as if we were vagrants who couldn't afford the order. It was abundantly clear as she exclaimed "it's  like 15 dollars"  there you have it ...a valley girl without the attractive California aesthetic.</11>
<12>Good burger spot in Pittsburgh with great options and good burgers. Cooked a little over for my liking even though ordered Medium. I realize this is a common mistake so I won't judge too harshly on this. Prices ok for the area, decent portions, friendly enough staff.</12>
<13>Stop here after my competition and had the picky butter and jelly burger. Pretty good. Then of course and it was a dessert cookie with vanilla ice cream to celebrate my winning today. Great timePiggy Butter and Jelly Burger</13>
<14>Pittsburgh loves its Burgatory! While I end up frequenting their Waterfront location the most, sometimes I will visit this spot as well if it's more convenient. Because of its location, this Burgatory is a nice option if you're in the North Shore/downtown area. Of course, it lacks the ample free parking that its other mall-based locations benefit from; so usually when I dine here, I've taken the T or parked downtown.The parking may be more limited here, but everything else we expect from a Burgatory is the same. Delish shakes? Check. Custom burgers? Double check. The ability to "get in line" via an app? Yup - nowadays you do that in Yelp itself, but it's such a handy feature, especially in this busy part of town.While this isn't my go-to Burgatory, they're certainly a tasty contender for dinner if you're in the general area. Whether you're in the mood for beef or chicken, you want a mushroom cap sandwich or salad, or you need a sweet cocktail or milkshake, they'll definitely satisfy your craving and send you home with a food coma!</14>
<15>Great service.Nice atmosphere.Location is great. Food is AMAZING.Build your own burger options are plentiful. You can't go wrong here.Their fries are fire! Hit the spot!</15>
<16>A simple concept with decent results, Burgatory remains to be regular of the restaurants I visit when I come to Pittsburgh. This was my first time at this location, and it holds the same value as the original and the others I've been to in the past.With several burger combos already on the menu, the appeal of Burgatory is customizing your own burger. From the type of protein, to the bun, sauces, toppings, seasonings, the possibilities are endless. You would have to be the pickiest person to not find some combination of all the magical flavors optioned to you.Everyone at the table got custom burgers. They were freshly prepared and brought out in barely any time at all. My burger was made exactly as I had ordered it. The one waiter even brought out an extra order of fries on the house when someone forgot to order theirs.Great burgers, great service, and limitless options - I will continue to put Burgatory at the top of my list of places to eat in Pittsburgh. This location has proved itself as well.</16>
<17>My boyfriend has been talking about Burgatory for some time, and we happen to stumble on one coincidentally when in Pittsburgh. We sat outside with a baby on their patio and it was well spaced out. Everyone pretty much got a custom-made burger, which you fill out with a pencil on the table. It's honestly slightly overwhelming with the amount of choices.... you can do beef to veggie to impossible burger to crab cake to wagu beef. That's not even half the protein options. I got their veggie burger on a brioche bun with garlic aioli, onion rub, guacamole, and lettuce red onion and tomato. I subbed for the fries per recommendation and am super happy I did. I also got the Bloody Mary, which was good. Not as spicy as I prefer, but definitely a solid drink. Atmosphere was super casual for a Sunday afternoon. I would definitely come back.</17>
<18>Awesome place with a great ambiance! Came in midweek for my wife's birthday and were promptly seated. There was ample patio, bar, booth and table seating depending on preference. Lots of fun signs and Pittsburgh swag on the walls as well. Waitress promptly came over to take drink orders and then a few minutes later for our food orders. My wife got the Piggy Butter & Jelly Burger and I made a custom one (see description in picture). The burgers were both great and and the chips were a nice touch too. Service was fast and we appreciated how many options there were to choose from. Finally, we also got one of the classic milkshakes to share. The milkshake wasn't too thick and was easily big enough for two to share. Prices were affordable and we'll definitely be back</18>
<19>Cook your burger right. Even the fries were not fresh. We've had a better burger from other Burgatory locations. We are just visiting for the weekend and the hype is not what it used to be. food quality is gone.</19>
<20>He been twice this week this place  was so good. The first  time I came I got the elk burger. It  was simply amazing. Everything from the flavors to the textures to the smells... Insane. Has to be top 3 burgers. It was pricey, but probably on par with what you  would expect for a craft burger right next to a stadium. I got it with a side of the quinoa salad to feel less guilty.Came back two days later because I was still thinking about their burger and wanted to try something else. Luckily during  happy  hour they have $5 apps, cocktails, and beer from 5-7. I ordered the  honey habanero wing and the  impossible  burger sliders for  $5 each. Amazing value! For the food quality though I'll be honest the wings were not that  good. The sauce  was good,  but  barely had any kick for  claiming to be habanero and  the  chicken  was  pretty dry, small, and tough in  places. The impossible  burger though.... Just  wow. I couldn't believe  it  has no meat in it! The  texture and taste are pretty damn  close to the real thing. Ii think I'd regular get this burger over your average  restaurant beef burger! So so so good. Extra  special  thanks to the  folks behind the bar  who  were super  nice. They  checked  on  me often which  was  nice since the food does kind of  come out slow (but  well worth it). I will definitely be  back.</20>
<21>We came to Burgatory on a Saturday around 2 PM & only waited a few minutes for the table! Everyone we were with got a milkshake  & it was fantastic! Everyone got a different flavor that we shared - peanut butter & cookie one was amazing! My favorite part of burgatory is building your own burger! This was the first time I tried the lettuce "bun" and it was perfect! The burger was delicious (& juicy) and our server was awesome (Jenn)! This location is in the heart of the north shore. Highly recommend!</21>
<22>You really can't go wrong with Burgatory. Create your own burger, what more could one want? This has been a nice addition to the northshore. I've been to this location several times and my experience has always been positive. If you're looking for a good burger, this is the place. I am not however a fan of their regular menu. The appetizer options are very limited and the items they offer aren't anything great, which is why I always choose the create your own burger. My go to is the bison. The portion size is perfect. You also have to be sure to try a milkshake  aometime, although I am usually to full from chowing down on my delicious burger. I love the chips that come with the burger so I usually don't  upgrade to another side. This location stays open late after late night home games, which is accommodating. They have a full bar & a good draft beer selection. The bar has several tv, making it a decent place to watch the game as well. If you haven't been to a Burgatory, check it out!</22>

<title>Federal Galley</title>
<description>Established in 2017. Located on the Nova Place grounds, Federal Galley is a launch pad for the most exciting new restaurant concepts in Pittsburgh. 

Federal Galley is the second food hall developed by Galley Group. The first location, Smallman Galley, was designed to provide aspiring restaurateurs a low-cost and low-risk opportunity to launch their own restaurant concepts. Federal Galley was designed with a similar goal in mind. We exist to break down the barriers to entry in this notoriously restrictive industry.

We cultivate and accelerate aspiring restaurateurs by providing a forum to showcase their capabilities, hone their craft, develop business acumen, and build a cult following behind their concepts. With four fully outfitted kitchens and over 200 seats we provide the infrastructure for Chefs to bring their concepts to market at low-risk and for low-cost.…</description>

<1>federal Galley is doing a fantastic job adhering to CDC guidance!   Tables outside and inside adhere to social distancing!  If you want to eat out, support local business, & feel safe - this is your place!  Touch free ordering, outside dining, considerate and safety conscience staff.</1>
<2>Great food, great atmosphere, great approach for keeping patrons safe. Tables are spaced to promote social distance and masks are required while walking around the restaurant. Federal Galley has also developed a system of ordering and paying for food which minimizes contact between staff and clients, keeping everyone safe. Shout out to Federal Galley for finding a system that works for them, while keeping everyone as well as possible.</2>
<3>Great food great prices, great outdoor area. If you have a large group or can't decide what you want to eat this place is perfect. There's tons of options and seating.</3>
<4>If you've never been there, then you gotta go!  But so you know, there are 4 different kitchens and they are not all equal. I had a yummy Dirty Dippy for brunch today. It was  delicious!  Eggs, home made chicken sausage, tomatoes, peppers, cheese yum. Hubby had chicken and waffles and we split some beignets which they turned into Greek Loukoumades.  Everything was delicious from Sultry F&B. My girl had pancakes and bacon from Provision Pgh. The bacon had a nice flavor and just the right amount of chewy to crispy. But the pancakes and syrup both had a strange flavor. I would not recommend for a child even though this was in the children's menu. Outdoor seating was nice on this not too chilly Fall day. We had to share a table with another party but it felt pretty separate. Also the ordering and payment is done online so everyone is safe in these Covid times. I can't wait to go back to try some of the other kitchens.</4>
<5>I would give this place 3.5 stars, but since I can't I'm giving it 4. I went to federal galley on a late weekday afternoon for lunch. They were taking necessary covid precautions, we sat on the patio which was lovely. The ordering system was also cool and convenient, they had a website listed on the table where you could order and pay easily. I had a barbacoa quesadilla from Guapo, it was a pretty average quesadilla served with rice and beans, the true standout of this dish was the salsa verde on the side which is a MUST try. The person I was eating with got a spicy smoked salmon bowl from Shaka, the portion of which was huge and it was delicious. We split an order of their pizza egg rolls, which was an interesting twist and was actually pretty tasty. This is definitely a place i would visit again to try when new places rotate, and they have enough options that it probably wouldn't get boring. It was a solid place for lunch, the food was good but mostly average!</5>
<6>Great dinner/hangout option for large groups. After hearing lots of great things, we checked out Federal Galley with friends last night. We arrived during peak dinner and were able to grab a table for 5 within 10 min! The restaurant incubator/food hall style is great for groups since you can bypass the back and forth of "what food are you in the food for today?", plus with counter service, there's no need to deal with splitting checks. Between the 5 of us, we got food from all 3 restaurants in Federal Galley: Gaupo, Shaka, and Which came first.I ordered from Gaupo and Provision PGH and was definitely satisfied with my meal. Things I liked: The Guaco Tacos were tasty and FILLING. They were served on deep fried tortillas, had plenty of meat, and the guac was good. We also ordered a side of Calabacitas, which could have been a meal itself! It was more cheesy that I had expected, and was more like a dip that we ate with the housemade chips. Provision had three sour beer options on draft, which I appreciated!Things I'd tweak: The red salsa on the tacos wasn't very flavorful, which felt like a missed opportunity.All in all a fun night out. Looking forward to eating outside on their patio  in the summer!</6>
<7>We love Smallman Galley, so we're excited to head to the North Side and check our Federal Galley. It's the same concept of four restaurants under one roof, as well as a bar area. I love that there are so many different options. There's truly something for everyone, which is great when you can't agree on what you're in the mood for for dinner! We ordered from Which Came First (grilled chicken salad) and Shaka (spicy salmon poke bowl). We enjoyed both options, and they were delivered to our table very quickly after ordering. They also offer a great happy hour of 1/2 off all beer, wine, and cocktails from 4:30-6:30 PM. There were only a few options of wine, but an extensive list of different beers on tap, as well as specialty cocktails. The only thing I didn't love at the bar area is there were a bunch of tiny flies; that's definitely not a deal breaker, as the food and drinks were delicious, but just something we noticed that wasn't great.</7>
<8>The Galleys around town aren't just a mess hall, but you find delicious vendors trying to build a brand for themselves! Federal is a great spot, especially in the warmer summer months. The venue gets a bit loud, and can be rented out for events like weddings, etc. Always check to see that they don't have an event before heading on a Friday or Saturday night!</8>

<10>Great lunch visit for all to this bustling food court with a great local beer selection. There are about five food businesses here, clean bathrooms, and a bar that serves up 25 (mostly) local beers on draft. I had a great meal by Guapo restaurant of New Mexican Carne Adovada enchiladas, served Xmas style with both green and red Hatch chile  pepper sauce. I paired it with a local beer by Cinderstown brewery. The rest of our party of four raved about their food, and it's great to have options when traveling with a group. There's a front patio, but the back patio looked amazing! Street parking was easy to find. Check 'em out!</10>
<11>Favorite happy hour in the city! Great drinks, great selection, great deals!Drinks: 5, Food: 2, Service: 3.5, Atmosphere: 5This is a sister restaurant of Smallman Galley in the Strip with a more open biergarden vibe. There are two outdoor seating areas with large benches on either side of the restaurant. It is also dog friendly! Inside there is a bar and along the sides are 4-5 different "incubator" restaurant concepts that rotate throughout the year. They also have live music/trivia events throughout the week.I typically do not come here for the food as I have tried a few things over the years and tend to find the food rather overpriced with small portion sizes. However, the happy hour drinks here are second to none. They have fantastic cocktails that are only $5-6 at happy hour and a sizeable draft list that ends up being about $3-4 for a beer (even nicer beers!). We come here as often as we can because their beer selection and cocktail quality cannot be beat for the price! The atmosphere is also great for hanging out especially when the weather is nice outside. The only downside is that service at the bar can be pretty slow during happy hour and can take about 10-15 minutes at time to order a drink. It especially gets crowded on Friday afternoon/evenings. There is also quite limited street parking with no garage so it can be hard to drive over at times. Overall one of my favorite places for happy hours!</11>
<12>I just checked out Federal Galley for the first time. I have gone to Smallman Galley in the past. We were looking for a place to do happy hour in the Northside and a few of our usual options were closed because it was a Monday. In a way it was a good thing because it meant we got to check out Federal Galley.For happy hour all alcohol (excluding carafes) is half off. They really have some great deals. They do have a cocktail menu but I did not order off that. They had a great beer selection. There was some local options but also some other great craft breweries. They had a good range of styles which I was all too happy to see in this IPA happy world. They also have a few ciders on tap. The Arsenal cider is a dedicated line so it is safe to drink for those who need to be gluten free.There was three of us in our group and after ordering our first round of drinks we found some seats at a high counter. They have bottles of water and glasses on all the tables. We then browsed the restaurant selections. There seems to be a little something for everyone and we were happy to find some vegetarian and gluten free options. We ordered from Shaka and from Provision. I will review those on their pages.Overall I would definitely be back if I'm in the area, especially for happy hour. I liked having so many options for both food and drink. It's great for groups as well because it can accommodate everyone's food preferences.</12>
<13>Popped in a late lunch. I love the many options one has to choose from! It was a tough choice. I went with the truffle tuna poke bowl as it was highly recommended by one of the employees. I was not disappointed. It was full of flavor and I left with a full belly. I did ask for a side of hot sauce and wow, it hits you with flavor and lots of heat! My only disappointment was the boba tea. The boba was slightly hard, not tasty at all and the tea was overly sweet. Everyone else seemed satisfied with their selection.</13>
<14>Federal Galley bar with a large beer selection and 4 little independent restaurants.  Today I ordered a late lunch from Guapo. The friendly guys at Guapo make a nice large tasty burrito.  This one has Xmas sauce with you can see the red and green colors.   It's large enough to save 1/2 for dinner too or the next day's lunch.The large space and plaza has ample room to spread out.</14>
<15>My husband and I love federal galley. This is one of the places we keep going back to. They have a rotating drink menu that usually features a charity cocktail (they donate $1-2 dollars if the drink to a selected charity). The drinks are always a good mix of sweet, sour, and complex and keep you from getting bored. The happy hour is great at 1/2 off all drinks! I do wish the restaurants would feature specials like Smallman galley does. The rotating restaurants keep things interesting. My current favorite is provision, they have a fun take on comfort food and always have big portions. The aioli they serve with the fries is amazing (although the fries are a little over salted).</15>
<16>I've been to the Federal Galley a few times and have had items from all but one of the restaurants. I really love the open space there and the availability of tables. I knows there's always a big debate between federal and Smallman and I always find myself picking federal over Smallman because it's bigger and there's so much more space. (I do like Smallman too though!) Provision- The crispy cauliflower is soo good! I would definitely go back and get that again. It was hands down the best thing I had here. We also had the asparagus was just ok. My mom also had the pork belly and she raved about it! El Lugar- I got the taco plate with the side salad. The side salad was fresh and light. I got the chicken taco, shredded beef taco and the fish taco. The taco's were good, however, I thought the chicken taco was a little bland. I've also had the chopped salad which was go good! Which came first- I got a wrap with grilled chicken Nashville style. It was so good. I'd go back and try more from their menu! My sister got the Nutella French toast and enjoyed it!</16>
<17>This spot was a lot of fun. It housed a handful of startup restaurants that share overhead and expenses. Everything looked amazing and the concept is novel and I hope it catches on all over.</17>
<18>What a cool place!  Similar to Smallman Galley.  Easy to miss in the northside since its nestled by children's museum area. You wouldn't know by just driving by.  Parking on the street.  Inside and out seating.   As far as food we only experienced "which came first" was amazing. The bar is cool - offers mixed drinks and drafts.  No bottled beer.    I love the spacious communal seating the dining area and water is provided on each table.  We are excited to go back and try other places..such as pizza from Michigan and Trumbull!!   We will be returning... thanks Federal Galley!</18>
<19>A great "restaurant incubator" to try out, especially if you like the vibe at Smallman Galley. You have great options including the staples: typical brunch food, mexican, and fried chicken as well as a booth that cycles asian food. Most of the portion sizes are very easily shareable but depending on the sub-restaurant, the price doesn't always justify the quality of food you're getting.The location is also a little awkward, not quite north side and not quite close to the stadiums, but still walkable. It's in the old Allegheny Mall, and within walking distance to the Children's Museum and the National Aviary.</19>
<20>I love that the Galley group has introduced the concept of the food hall to Pittsburgh, and has done so with two awesome locations. Federal Galley is a great space, with plenty of open space and seating indoors, and outdoor seating in both the back and front of the building. The floor to ceiling windows/doors that open make this place always feel bright and happy. The food options are solid (I won't go into too many details in this general review). It seems that the owners do a nice job of rotating interesting and unique restaurant concepts through so there are options for every tastebud that walks in. My favorite part of Federal Galley? Half price happy hour. What better way to end the workday (or workweek) with a half-priced glass of wine (or cocktail or local craft beer). I have been hard-pressed to find a happy hour in Pittsburgh that I enjoy as much as this one. I also appreciate the live music on the weekend and the many cool different events that are hosted here. Thanks, Federal Galley, for being a beloved staple of the northside!</20>
<21>The place so nice we went there twice... in two days! Once again, we had a great experience. Today we took our four year old along with a friend and her daughter. They split chicken, fries, and mac and cheese from Which Came First. All three choices were delicious, but the kiddos weren't into the non-Kraft mac so we got to indulge. We also got veggie nachos from Guapo which were good! It was a great way to enjoy some music from the Deutschtown Music Festival.</21>
<22>This place was fantastic. The drinks and food were all wonderful and the people were as well. My husband had a burger from Provision with a side salad and I had enchiladas from Guapo and let me tell you that the enchiladas were one of my favorite meals I've had in recent history. I also tried a tropical Moscow mule which was absolutely delicious.</22>

<description>"Dining Room, Bar and Takeout are OPEN for Business!  Wednesday - Sunday, 5 pm to 8 pm."</description>
<reviews>
<1>They are back open. Service is great. Food is great. They're following all precautions with regard to COVID19. Felt good to be back.</1>
<2>Many years later, still great! So glad they're open for dine-in.  Came last night and had perogies and a salad because they didn't have the veggie burger.  Tasty and still love the huge tumbler for soda!</2>
<3>Union Grill is very good. Situated between the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University, Union Grill is a solid, close to campus option for students bringing their parents to a pricer, sit down option. After putting our name down, my friend and I waited about 20 minutes for a table. The ambience is warm and quiet enough to have a conversation without shouting. Your grandparents should be able to hear you while they visit you in Pittsburgh. I'm really sticking with this as a parent's weekend restaurant for students. It's just what it is.I am highly satisfied with the Pittsburgh centric options on the menu. Other than that, most of the options are simple burgers, meats, and seafood options. I want to focus on the latter. I ordered the fish tacos, or fish taco. Well, it's really more of an open face burrito. The fish was delicious and the slaws and sauces, but the guacamole tasted old and was turning grey. I was very impressed with the quality of the fish and will go back to try the other options.All and all, a tasty, timely experience. Bring your family here on family weekend.</3>
<4>Union Grill is one of the cutest bar located about a block away from The Carnegie Museum of Art. I highly recommend coming here and take advantage of their local craft beer for just $4. Seriously the most delicious craft beer ever...they have a ton of selection you can choose from that would surely satisfy your thirst. I really liked how they served a tray of fresh popcorn...they actually have this old fashioned popcorn machine right by the bar.Union Grill is fairly spacious where you can either enjoy a drink or meal at the bar comfortably or try to get a table and have a nice dinner. This place was amazing I really wish I had more time here. I was feeling a bit hungry and ordered their chicken tenders...the meat was juicy and crunchy and my meal was filling.Overall great customer services, my bartender was filled with positive energy and so bubbly. And most importantly this place was affordable.</4>
<5>My wife and I and my parents who where visiting decided to go to the Union Grill for dinner.I had the pot roast with mashed potatoes and a french onion soup.The service was excellent and the food was pretty good.I was happy with the fast friendly service.I would go back again.I you are in the area it is worth a stop.</5>
<6>My son found this place coming off campus at CMU, right around the corner. What a great little find. The lunch scene can be a bit busy, but its manageable. Service was excellent. Plenty of draft beers (after walking 5 miles on a college visit). My son got the burger (huge !) and I got the lunch spell (salad and sandwich) for 10 bucks. See photos. Both were excellent and I would get the very same thing again :)You won't be disappointed. If he gets accepted, I will visit again. Good luck Union Grill</6>
<7>If your in the mood for solid good ol American style food then this is a great place to try.My friend who grew up in Pittsburgh said to me lets go have a good dinneryup that's me wanting a good dinnerits not a fancy place they have a bar and they have the TV going above iton a Friday about 5 the place was hopping we were seated after about 5 min wait time Our friendly waitress was there instantly therethey have a menu  filled with burgers and other classics like chicken including a Devonshire which I might try one dayI had a salmon sandwich its was very tastyDebbie has a hummus plate it was a very generous portion including salad and veggiesok are you ready the best dessert Smores 5 dollars gets you graham crackers marshmallows and a Hershey bar plus a little hibachi to cook onthe portion could have easily fed another person or two a perfect ending for a delish mealI will be back</7>
<8>What a great place! We made reservations for 6 for a Saturday night and so glad we did! We were greeted and seated immediately. The server, Sara was phenomenal and got our bar drinks quickly with a smile to boot! We all ordered different meals and we all were blown away! The fish sandwich was by FAR the best I've ever eaten. Cooked perfectly. My hubby had the chicken sandwich with waffle fries and he said it was exquisite! French onion burger was superb! Steaks cooked perfectly with a side of cremini mushrooms and garlic butter. Dessert was s'mores that you cooked at your table. One of the best places we've visited by far. Shout out to Sara without an h for a pleasant fun evening. We will be back soon!</8>
<9>This is a great spot for a nice family meal, a quiet evening with your significant other, or a group of friends.  The ambiance is nice and inviting.  They have a small outdoor space in front if the weather is decent.  The food is always good and so is the service.  Affordable prices, with a nice selection of Pennsylvania ice cold beers.  I love this place!</9>
<10>I love this place.  It's a real Pittsburgh original and has been here as long as I can remember.  The portions are huge. The food is delicious.  They have 10.00 bottles of wine and tabletop smores.  This is also a place to try Pittsburgh's own Turkey Devonshire. If you haven't had this before you must try. This is a huge sandwich and is enough for to. Ask them to split it for you and a friend. They also have some of the best pierogi in the city.</10>
<11>My faves:-Matzo Ball Soup-Pittsburgh Salad-Turkey DevonshireI walk from Bloomfield to Oakland several times a week and always past Union Grill which I inevitably end up popping in for a bite.My boyfriend and I are big fans of sharing/splitting meals when we go out to eat because potions are so huge everywhere we go. This is no exception. Plus it allows us to eat without overdoing it.The food has always been good for me and the same with the service.</11>
<12>I was lured in with the description of their 5 hour pot roast - recipe unchanged for 25 years. Or something like that. We arrived on a cold Sunday in January just before 5pm and were sat right away. It got much more busy over the next hour so you might want to call ahead since parking isn't exactly suburban. The pot roast comes with mashed red potatoes, which were good, and the vegetable of the day which was broccoli. The broccoli was a total miss. It was over cooked and didn't go well with a dish that was begging for carrots. The pot roast nevertheless was very good. The red wine and tomato added to the beef stock made it distinctive and delicious.  You get a large portion, much more than you should probably eat. I ate it all anyway so I had to skip even considering dessert!</12>
<13>I was really looking forward to trying this place, and it definitely lived up to the hype. I had the church pierogies and the turkey Devonshire and both were excellent. Highly recommended!</13>
<14>Stopped by for a quick snack. All the servers were super friendly and professional. I appreciated that they had a nice selection of local taps. The frosted mugs were a really nice touch. I got an order of the pierogis, and they were perfect. I appreciated that they were pretty delicate and had nice flavor. Good place for a snack and a beer!</14>
<15>Solid comfort food, for a very reasonable price right on the edge of the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University campuses.  My family and I had a rough day and needed something warm and soothing for lunch.  We were seated at a back corner booth and ordered a mess of food to share....both appetizers and main dishes.The salad we got was filled with a perfectly grilled chicken breast, tons of veggies, avocado, bacon chunks and a delicious homemade ranch dressing.The potato and cheese pierogis were just average.  They were topped with melted shredded cheese and served with sour cream, but they were slightly on the greasy side.The chicken tenders with waffle fries and homemade honey mustard dressing were perfectly on point.  We all loved the honey mustard so much we ordered more and also another order of fries just so we could dip!Everyone wanted a bite of the turkey Devonshire.  It was rich, creamy and super-filling topped with bacon slices and that cheese sauce bubbling straight out of the oven with a charred surface to it.  Yum, yum, yum!I thought we were done, then our younger daughter decides she wanted a dessert...and who could resist a $2 brownie sundae?  The mini brownie sundae was cute, with a brownie that was slightly underdone (loved it) and served warm with vanilla ice cream.From there, we simply crawled back to our daughter's dorm in our food-induced coma.  Thank you, Union Grill!!!</15>
<16>They're back open and the place looks great, it's been renovated and really looks nice. Also the food and service was great as it always was. Glad to see familiar faces working (well through masks). It was good to be back!</16>
<17>Lived in Pittsburgh for almost 18 years and this was the first time eating at Union Grill. They accommodated our large group and the food and service were great. This may have been the first time I age there, but it won't be our last.</17>
<18>It is a small place with amazing food and within walking distance of carnegie museum of natural history. Would definitely go again!</18>
<19>I started with the mazo soup. This had great flavor and was delicious. I also got the church perogies as a side. The onions were grilled to perfection and the perogies were very good. For my meal I had the seafood cake with the vegetable and broccoli. Everything was very tasty and all of the portions were generous. The place did get busier as I was here so make sure to get here early.</19>
<20>Came here for dinner with my partner and his colleague. It was an interesting mix of very young college-aged kids, and seniors meeting up with their friends to dine. I guess it's nice that they serve such a wide demographic, age-wise. I got the Pittsburgh salad (apparently adding "Pittsburgh" to it means adding French fries?), and a Canadian Mule - drink specials are like unicorns to me, being from puritanical Boston. Both were perfectly adequate. I would frequent go to Union Grill if I was a co-ed looking to get great value for what I pay, or maybe a senior who holds great nostalgia for the place...? There's a lot to choose from, and the food was good!</20>
